The
Pres

This
week
I've
been
trav
el
ing
across
the
coun
try
--
from
North
Carolina
to
Ge
or
gia
to
here
at
Hyde
Park
Academy
in
my
home
town
of
Chicago
--
talk
ing
with
folks
about
the
im

tasks
that
I
laid
out
in
my
State
of

Union
Ad

the
true
en
gine
of
Amer
ica's
eco
nomic
growth
--
a
ris
ing
thriv
ing
mid

Every
we
should
ask
our
selves
three
ques
tions:
How
do
we
bring
good
jobs
to
Amer
i
ca?
How
do
we
equip
peo
ple
with
the
skills
those
jobs
re
quire?
And
how
do
we
make
sure
your
hard
work
leads
to
a
de
cent
liv
ing?
I
be
lieve
all
that
starts
by
mak
ing
Amer
ica
a
mag
net
for
new
jobs
and
man
u
fac

ing
After
shed
ding
jobs
for
more
than
10
years
our
man
u
fac
tur
ers
have
added
about
500,000
jobs
over
the
past
three
What
we
need
to
do
now
is
sim
ple
We
need
to
ac
cel
er
ate
that
trend
We
need
to
launch
man
u
fac
tur
ing
hubs
across
the
coun
try
that
will
trans
form
hard
-
hit
re
gions
into
global
cen
ters
of
high
-
tech
jobs
and
man
u
fac
tur
ing
We
need
to
make
our
tax
code
more
com
pet
i
tive
end
ing
tax
breaks
for
com
pa
nies
that
ship
jobs
over
seas
and
re
ward
ing
com
pa
nies
that
cre
ate
jobs
here
at
home
And
we
need
to
in
vest
in
the
re
search
and
tech
nol
ogy
that
will
al
low
us
to
har
ness
more
of
our
en
ergy
and
put
more
peo
ple
back
to
work
re
pair
ing
our
crum
bling
roads
and
bridges
Th
ese
steps
will
help
our
busi
nesses
ex
pand
and
cre
ate
new
jobs
But
we
also
need
to
pro
vide
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
with
the
skills
and
train
ing
that
they
need
to
fill
those
jobs
Let's
start
in
the
ear
li
est
years
by
of
fer
ing
high
-
qual
ity
pre
-
school
to
ev
ery
child
in
Amer
ica
be
cause
we
know
kids
in
these
pro
grams
do
bet
ter
through
out
their
lives
Let's
re
design
our
high
schools
so
that
our
stu
dents
grad
u
ate
with
the
skills
that
em
ploy
ers
are
look
ing
for
right
And
be
cause
tax
pay
ers
can't
con
tinue
to
sub
si
dize
the
soar
ing
cost
of
higher
ed
u
ca

I've
called
on
Congress
to
take
af
ford
abil

and
value
into
ac
count
when
de
ter
min
ing
which
col
leges
re
ceive
cer

types
of

So
those
are
steps
we
can
take
to
help
bring
good
jobs
to
Amer
ica
and
equip
our
peo
ple
with
the
skills
those
jobs
re
quire
And
that
brings
us
to
the
third
ques
tion
--
how
do
we
make
sure
hard
work
leads
to
a
de
cent
liv
ing?
No
one
in
Amer
ica
should
work
full
-
time
and
raise
their
chil
dren
in
poverty
So
let's
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
so
that
it's
a
wage
you
can
live
on.
And
it's
time
to
har

tal

and

Th

steps
will

grow

and
re
build
a
ris

And
we
can
do
it
while
shrink
ing
our
deficits
We
don't
have
to
choose
be
tween
the
two
--
we
just
have
to
make
smart
choices
Over
the
last
few
years
both
par

have
worked
to
gether
to
re
duce
the
deficit
by
more
than
$2.5

which
puts
us
more
than
half

to

goal
of

we

But
I

That
would

while

That

We
can't
just
cut

In

I've
pro

one
that
makes

to

So
we

All
the

I've

are

In
the

our
work
won't
be
easy

we

But

That's

The
Pres

After
a
decade
of
hard

for

fam

and
a
re
ces

that
wiped
away
mil
lions
of

we
're
in
the
mid

of
a
tough
fight
to
re
build
this
econ
omy
and
put
folks
back
to
work
Win
ning
this
fight
will
not
de
pend
on
gov
ern
ment
alone
It
'll
de
pend
on
the
in
no
va

of
Amer
i

en

on
the
drive
of
Amer
i
can
small
busi

own

on
the
skills
and
tal

of
Amer
i
can
work

Th
ese
are
the
peo
ple
who
will
help
us
grow
our
econ
omy
and
cre
ate
jobs
But
gov
ern
ment
still
has
an
im
por
tant
re
spon
si
bil
ity
And
that's
to
cre
ate
an
en
vi

ment
in
which
some
one
can
raise
cap
i
tal
to
start
a
new
com
pa

where
a
busi

can
get
a
loan
to
ex
pand;
where
in
ge
nu

is
prized
and
folks
are
re

for
their
hard
work
That's
why
I
fought
so
hard
to
pass
a
jobs
bill
to
cut
taxes
and
make
more
loans
avail

for

It
elim

And
it's
free

who
need
it.
In

in

and
spur
hir

by
busi

across

one
of
the
keys
to

cre

is
to
en
cour

com

to

in
the
United

But
for
years
our
tax
code
has
ac

given
bil

in

that
en
cour

com
pa

to

and

in

I
want
to
close
these
tax
loop
holes
In

I
want
to
give
ev

busi

in
Amer
ica
a
tax
break
so
they
can
write
off
the
cost
of
all
new

next

That's
go
ing
to
make
it
eas

for
folks
to
ex

new

I
also
want
to

And
I
want
to

Be

we

Th

When

more

are

more

in

But
Repub

in

have
con

fought
to
keep
these

open
Over

Repub

in

11

That

It

A

That's
a

But
there's
no
rea

why
our
tax

should
ac

re

them
for

over

In

we
should
be

our

to

com

that
cre

We

We

This

It's
a

to

the

around

and
to
make
our

Part
of
this

in

in
creas
ing
our

ex

ration
right
here
in
Amer
ica
In
fact
our
oil
pro
duc
tion
last
year
reached
its
high
est
level
since
2003
and
we
want
to
en
cour

more

where
we
But
the
truth
is,
drilling
alone
is
not
a
real
strat
egy
to
re
place
our
de
pen
dence
on
for
eign
And
that's
be
cause
even
though
Amer
ica
uses
25%
of
the
world's
we
cur
rently
have
only
about
2%
of
the
world's
oil
re
serves
Even
if
we
used
ev
ery
last
drop
of
all
the
oil
we
have
it
wouldn't
be
enough
to
meet
our
long
-
term
en

needs
So,
real
en
ergy
se
cu
rity
can
only
come
if
we
find
ways
to
use
less
oil
--
if
we
in
vest
in
cleaner
fu

and
greater
ef
fi

That's
what
we
've

For

So
if

the
bet
ter

is
go

about

Al
to

this
will
save
us
about

So
we

In

But
in

That's

That's

And
the

this

We

it's
not

We

We

That's

We

We

We

many
in

en

from
quickly
turn

new

into
thriv

which
holds
back
our

It's
time
Congress
fi

passed
a
set
of
trade
deals
that
would
help
dis

work

look

for
new

and
that
would
al

our
busi

to

South

And
we

to
all
those
con

work

who
lost
their

when
the

We
could
put

to

by

Those
are
a

steps
that
would
help

and
these
are
ideas
that
have
been
sup
ported
by
both
Democrats
and
Repub

in
the

So
I'm
go

to
keep
call

on
both

in

to
put

their

After

Both

Hi,

In

And
in
a

that's
in
creas

built
on

and
in
no

a
core
el

of
this
mid

eco
nom

is
how
well
we
pre

our

for

For

we
threw
money
at

with

mak

sure
our

were
ac
tu

im

or
whether
we
were

the

they
need
or
whether
our
tax

were
be

used
ef
fec

And
our
kids
too
of

paid
the
price
over
the
past
few
years
we
've
seen
signs
that
our
el

and
sec

are

Last

our
younger
stu

earned
the
high

and
read

on

Last

we
learned
that
our
high

a

high
This
is
progress
But
in
a
21st

econ

our

will
only
do
bet

than
we
did
if
we

So
we
have
to

fully

and

This

I
want
to

No

in

and
gives
ev

a
fair

in
the

it's
pretty
com
mon
sense
that
an

should

im
prove
ed

But
as
we
speak
there's
a
Repub

can
bill
in
Congress
that
would
frankly
do
the
op
po
site
At
a
time
when
we
should
in
vest
more
in
our
kids
their
plan
would
lock
in
cuts
to

for
the
rest
of
this

We'd
end
up
ac
tu
ally
in
vest
less
in
our
kids
in
2021
than
we
did
in
2012
At
a
time
when
we
should
give
our
teach

all
the
re
sources
they
need
their
plan
could
let
states
and
cities
shuf
fle
ed
u
ca

dol

into
things
like

sta

or
tax
cuts
for
the

At
a
time
when
we
have
to
give
ev
ery
child
ev
ery
where
a
fair
shot
-
this
Congress
would
ac
tu
ally
al
low
states
to
make
even
deeper
cuts
into

dis

that
need
the
most
sup

send
even
more

to
some
of

i
est
school
dis

in
Amer

and
turn
back
the
clock
to
a
time
when
too
many
stu

were
left
be

in
fail
ing

Deny

a
qual

ed

to
the
chil

of

is
as
wrong
as
deny

We
are
bet
ter
than
this
I
have
a
dif

ent
vi

for
the
mid

In
to

world
we
have
to
equip
all
our

with
an
ed

ca

that
pre
pares
them
for
suc

re
gard
less
of
what
they
look
like
or
how
much
their
par

make
or
the
zip
code
they
live
in.
And
that
means
try
ing
new
things
in
vest
ing
in
what's
work
ing
and
fix
ing
what's
That
means
cut
ting
test

down
to
the
bare
min
i

re
quired
to
make

par

and
teach

know
how
our
kids
and
schools
are
do
ing
from
year

and
rel
a

to

statewide
That
means
giv
ing
the
teach

and
prin
ci
pals
who
do
the
hard
work
ev
ery
day
the
re
sources
they
need
to
spend
less
time
teach
ing
to
a
test
and
more
time
teach
ing
our
kids
the
skills
they
need
Some
of
these
changes
are
hard
They
'll
re
quire
all
of
us
to
de

more
of
our

and
more
of
our

mak
ing
sure
they
put
down
the
video

and
pick
up

They

some

a

doesn't

But
I'm

When

Hi
ev
ery

As
I
said
in
my
State
of
the
Union
ad
dress
we
live
in
a
time
of
ex
tra
or
di
nary
change
-
change
that's
af
fect
ing
the
way
we
live
and
the
way
we
work
New
tech
nol
ogy
re
places
any
job
where
work
can
be
au
to
mated
Work
ers
need
more
skills
to
get
ahead
Th
ese
changes
aren't
and
they
're
only
go
ing
to
ac
cel
er
ate
So
the
ques
tion
we
have
to
ask
our
selves
is,
"How
can
we
make
sure
ev
ery
one
has
a
fair
shot
at
suc
cess
in
this
new
econ
o
my?"
The
an
swer
to
that
ques
tion
starts
with
ed
u
ca
tion
That's
why
my
Ad
min
is
tra
tion
has
en
cour
aged
states
to
raise
stan
dards
We
've
cut
the
dig
i
tal
di
vide
in
our
class
rooms
in
half
We
've
worked
with
Congress
to
pass
a
bi
par
ti
san
bill
to
set
the
ex
pec
ta
tion
that
ev
ery
stu
dent
should
grad
u
ate
from
high
school
ready
for
col
lege
and
a
good
And
thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
stu
dents
teach
ers
and
par
ents
across
the
coun
try
our
high
school
grad
u
a
tion
rate
is
at
an
all
-
time
high
Now
we
have
to
make
sure
all
our
kids
are
equipped
for
the
jobs
of
the
fu
ture
-
which
means
not
just
be
ing
able
to
work
with
com
put
ers
but
de
vel
op
ing
the
an
a
lyt
i
cal
and
cod
ing
skills
to
power
our
in
no
va

econ
omy
To
day's
auto
me
chan
ics
aren't
just
slid
ing
un
der
cars
to
change
the
oil;
they
're
work
ing
on
ma
chines
that
run
on
as
many
as
100
mil
lion
lines
of
code
That's
100
times
more
than
the
Space
Shut
tle
Nurses
are
an
a
lyz
ing

and
man
ag

elec

Ma
chin

are
writ

com
puter

And
work
ers
of
all
kinds
need
to
be
able
to
fig
ure
out
how
to
break
a
big
prob
lem
into
smaller
pieces
and
iden
tify
the
right
steps
to
solve
it.
In
the
new
econ
omy
com
puter
sci
ence
isn't
an
op
tional
skill
-
it's
a
ba
sic
skill
right
along
with
the
three
"Rs."
Nine
out
of
ten
par

want
it
taught
at
their

schools
Yet
right
only
about

Twenty

two

So
I've
got
a
plan
to

in

First
I'm

That's

Thanks

To

And
just

for:
the

given

of
Amer

and
the

of

This
is
also
a
hol
i

that
cap

that
dis
tinctly
Amer

to

some

Even
as

are

con

and
stand

around
the

And
in
a
larger
sense
that's
em
blem
atic
of
what
Amer
i

have
al
ways
done
We
've
come
to
gether
and
done
what's
re
quired
to
make
to

bet

to

That's
who
we
Con

since
that

Thanks

We
're
among
the
world's
youngest
of

but
time
and
again
we
have
boldly
and
re

led

for

Against
tough

we
're
a
peo
ple
who
en

--
who
ex
plored
and
set

a
vast

un

who
built
a
pow
er
ful
econ

and
stood
against
tyranny
in
all
its
forms;
who
marched
and
fought
for
equal

and
con

a
globe
with
our
sci

and
imag
i
na

None
of
that
progress
was
pre
des

None
of
it
came
eas
ily
In
stead
the
bless

for
which
we
give
thanks
to

are
the
prod

of

made
by
our

This

we
must
re

once
more
to

This
is
not
the
hard

Thanks

But
as

of

we
've

As

and

and

And
as

And

But
we

We

And
in

I

that
we

In

we

get
a

For
what
we
are
called
to

again
to

isn't
about
Democrats
or
Repub

It's
not
about

It's

It's

It's

Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I've
been
speak
ing
about
Amer
ica's
na
tional
se
cu
rity
--
our
past
our
present
and
our
fu
ture
On
Thurs
day
I
out
lined
the
fu
ture
of
our
fight
against
ter
ror
ism
--
the
threats
we
face
and
the
way
in
which
we
will
meet
them
On
Fri
day
I
went
to
An
napo
lis
to
cel
e
brate
the
ex
tra
or
di
nary
young
men
and
women
of
the
United
States
Naval
Academy's
Class
of
2013
--
the
sailors
and
Marines
who
will
not
only
lead
that
fight
but
who
will
lead
our
coun
try
for
decades
to
come
And
on
Mon
day
we
cel
e
brate
Me
mo
rial
Unof
fi
cially
it's
the
start
of
sum
mer
--
a
chance
for
us
to
spend
some
time
with
fam
ily
and
friends
at
bar
be
cues
or
the
beach
get
ting
a
lit
tle
fun
and
re
lax
ation
in
be
fore
head
ing
back
to
work
It's
also
a
day
on
which
we
set
aside
some
time
on
our
own
or
with
our
fam
i
lies
to
honor
and
re
mem
ber
all
the
men
and
women
who
have
given
their
lives
in
ser
vice
to
this
coun
try
we
love
They
are
he
roes
each
and
ev
ery
They
gave
Amer
ica
the
most
pre
cious
thing
they
had
--
"the
last
full
mea
sure
of
de
vo
tion."
And
be
cause
they
we
are
who
we
are
to
day
--
a
free
and
pros
per
ous
na
tion
the
great
est
in
the
world
At
a
time
when
only
about
1%
of
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
bear
the
bur
den
of
our
de
fense
the
ser
vice
and
sac
ri
fice
of
our
men
and
women
in
uni
form
isn't
al
ways
read
ily
ap
par
ent
That's
partly
be
cause
our
sol
diers
sailors
air
men
Marines
and
coast
guards
men
are
so
skilled
at
what
they
do.
It's
also
be
cause
those
who
serve
tend
to
do
so
qui
etly
They
don't
seek
the
lime
light
They
don't
serve
for
our
ad
mi
ra
tion
or
even
our
grat
i
tude
They
risk
their
lives
and
many
give
their
lives
for
some
thing
larger
than
them
selves
or
any
of
us:
the
ideals
of
lib
erty
and
jus
tice
that
make
Amer
ica
a
bea
con
of
hope
for
the
world
That's
been
true
through
out
our
his
tory
--
from
our
ear
li
est
days
when
a
tiny
band
of
rev
o
lu
tion
ar
ies
stood
up
to
an
Em
pire
to
our
9/11
Gen
er
a
tion
which
con
tin
ues
to
serve
and
sac
ri
fice
to
day
Every
time
a
threat
has
risen
Amer
i
cans
have
risen
to
meet
it.
And
be
cause
of
that
courage
--
that
will
ing
ness
to
fight
and
even
die
--
Amer
ica
en
dures
That
is
the
pur
pose
of
Me
mo
rial
To
re
mem
ber
with
grat
i
tude
the
count
less
men
and
women
who
gave
their
lives
so
we
could
know
peace
and
live
in
free
dom
And
we
must
do
more
than
re
mem
ber
We
must
care
for
the
loved
ones
that
our
fallen
ser
vice
mem
bers
have
left
be
hind
We
must
make
sure
all
our
vet
er
ans
have
the
care
and
ben
e
fits
they
've
earned
and
the
jobs
and
op
por
tu
nity
they
de
serve
We
must
be
there
for
the
mil
i
tary
fam
i
lies
whose
loved
ones
are
in
harm's
way
--
for
they
serve
as
well
And
above
we
must
make
sure
that
the
men
and
women
of
our
armed
forces
have
the
sup
port
they
need
to
achieve
their
mis
sions
safely
at
home
and
abroad
The
young
men
and
women
I
met
at
the
Naval
Academy
this
week
know
the
mean
ing
of
ser
vice
They
've
stud
ied
the
he
roes
of
our
his
tory
They
've
cho
sen
to
fol
low
in
their
foot
steps
--
to
stand
their
watch
man
a
ship
lead
a
pla
toon
They
are
do
ing
their
part
And
each
of
us
must
do
ours
So
this
week
end
as
we
com
mem
o
rate
Me
mo

I
ask
you
to
hold
all
our
fallen
he
roes
in
your
hearts
And
ev
ery
let's
work
to
gether
to
pre
serve
what
their
sac
ri
fices
achieved
--
to
make
our
coun

Hi,

But
our

should
ex

be
yond
what
our

have
done
for

in

It
should
re
mind
us
of
our

si
bil

to
serve
them
as
well
as
they
have
served
us.
It

com

We
've
now
slashed
the
dis

back

by
nearly
90
per

from
its
peak
We
're

and
we

The

is
down
to
3.9

-
even
lower
than
the

Of

we

We

Less

So

Without

Hello

In

Years
of

over

and
a

--
com

brought

that's

for
a

to
the
brink
of
col

We
didn't
have
many
good
op

On
the
one
hand
we
could
have
con

the
prac

of

of

dol

to
the

with
no
real

On
the
other
hand
we
could
have
walked
away
and
al
lowed
two
ma

to
go
out
of

--
which
could
have
wiped
out
one
mil
lion
Amer
i
can

I
re
fused
to
let
that
hap
pen
So
we
came
up
with
a
third
We
said
to
the
auto

if
you
're

to
make
the
hard
de

nec
es

in

21st

we
'll
make
a
one

time
in

in

Of

if
some

This

One
called
it
"the

could
pos

They
said
we
should
just
walk
away
and
let
these
jobs
go.
To
day
the
men
and
women
in
this
plant
are
prov

Since
GM

Chrysler
emerged
from

our

has
added
55,000

--
the
strong

of

in

10

For
the
first
time
since
2004
all

And

What's

to

40%

That's
real
progress
There's
no
doubt
that
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
and
a

of
work
to

But
what's

is
that
we
're

to

some
of
the
tough

And
if

if
we

what
the

of

--
none
of

Still
even
as

we
also

As

so
they

That's
what
we
're
try

to

with

--
a

that
has
been

as

To

Chrysler

it

And
this

we
reached
a

to
sell

And
that

Chrysler

be
100%

Most
im

all

Amer

are
now
adding
shifts
and
cre
at

jobs
at
the
strong
est

since
the
1990s
Chrysler
has
added
a
sec

shift
at
the
Jef
fer
son
North
plant
in
Detroit
that
I
vis
ited
last

GM
is
adding
a
third
shift
at
its
Ham

for
the
first

And
GM
plans
to
hire
back
all
of
the
work
ers
they
had
laid
off
dur

the
re

That's
re
mark
able
when
you
think
about
where
we
were
just
a

of

When
I
took
of

we
were

the

a

We

But
that
would

worse
and
put

I
re

After

This

It

But
this

Last

I

Th

have

with

in
some
of

But
for
many
of

the

don't
end
when
they
take

To

more

850,000

That's

We

to
leave
their

and
their

and
risk
their

to

The
last

they

have

is

for
a

when

To

On

the
streets
of
Lon

Paris
and

and
the

of

that

so

But
for
a

in
the

Gen

"The

he

By
the
time
the

fell
silent
in
Europe
some
40
mil
lion
peo

on
the

had
lost
their
lives
To

we
pay
trib

to
all
who

They
were
pa

and
the
women
of
the
WACs

They
risked
their
lives
and
gave
their
lives
so
that
we,
the
peo

the

could
live
free
They
were
women
who
stepped
up
in
un

man
ning
the

and
-
like
my
grand

-
build

This
was
the
gen

a

that
lit

ally
saved
the
world
-
that
ended
the
war
and
laid
a
foun

for

This
was
the
gen

a

that
traded
in
their
uni

for
a

so
they

their
sweet

buy

raise

I

Mil

For

Com

All

What

The

Hi
ev

In
my
State
of
the
Union
Ad

I
said
that
the
best

is
ac

to

And
af
ter
the
worst
re

of
our

times
our
busi

have
cre
ated
eight
and
a
half
mil
lion
new
jobs
in
the
last
four
years
But
we
need
to
do
more
to
make
Amer
ica
a
mag
net
for
good
jobs
for
the
fu

And
in
this
year
of
ac

where
Congress
won't
do
that
I
will
do
what
ever
I
can
to
ex
pand
op

for

Amer

This
week
I
took
two

to

Here's
why
this
is
im
por
tant
In
the
2000s
alone
we
lost
more

one

third

Amer

One

And
when

in
the

in

were
hit
harder
than
just
about
any

The
good
news
is,
to
day
our
man
u
fac

have
added
more
than
620,000
jobs
over
the
last
four
years
-
the
first
sus
tained
growth
in
man
u
fac
tur
ing
jobs
since
the
1990s
Still
the
econ
omy
has
changed
If
we
want
to
at
tract
more
good
man
u
fac

ing
jobs
to
Amer
ica
we
've
got
to
make

we
're

of
