And
we
're
putting

so
Main

our

But
the
way
for

to

isn't
to

It's

The

I'm

with

from
Mi

where
I'm

Mi

that's

I
came
here
with
Jeb

for
mer
gov
er
nor
of
this

be
cause
he
and
I
share
the
view
that
ed
u
ca

isn't
a
par
ti
san
is
sue
--
it's
an
Amer
i
can
is
sue
But
in
a
larger
sense
this
is
a
mo
ment
when
we
've
all
got
to
do
what
the
stu
dents
and
the
teach
ers
are
do
ing
here
We
've
got
to
step
up
our
game
Our
top
pri
or

right
now
has
to
be
cre
at
ing
new
jobs
and
op
por
tu
ni
ties
in
a
fiercely
com
pet
i
tive
world
And
this
week
we
re
ceived
very
good
news
on
that
front
We
learned
that
the
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
has
fallen
to
its
low
est
level
in
nearly
two
years
as
our
econ
omy
added
an
other
222,000
pri
vate
sec
tor
jobs
last
month
we
have
a
lot
more
work
to
do,
not
just
for
the
Amer
i
cans
who
still
don't
have
jobs
but
for
the
mil
lions
more
who
still
don't
have
the
right
job
or
all
the
work
they
need
to
live
out
the
Amer
i
can
Dream
But
the
progress
we
're
see
ing
says
some
thing
about
the
de
ter
mi
na
tion
and
in
ge
nu
ity
of
our
peo
ple
and
our
busi
nesses
What's
also
help
ing
to
fuel
this
eco
nomic
growth
are
the
tax
cuts
that
Democrats
and
Repub
li
cans
came
to
gether
to
pass
in
De

and
that
I
signed

to

Just
as
both

co
op

ated
on

re

that
is
now
fu

job

we
need
to

The

it
also
in

a
5-year

and
it
will
re
duce
our

by
$1
tril

over
the
next

In

the

I've
pro

would
bring

But
we

It's
one
of

Govern

We

The
good
news
is,
Democrats

That

I'm

Hi,

To

Septem

26th
is
"Na

It's
a

where
you

and

of
ex

un

pre

at
col
lec

sites
in
your
com
mu

Here's
why
this
mat
ters
More
Amer
i
cans
now
die
ev
ery
year
from
drug
over
doses
than
they
do
in
car
crashes
And
most
of
those
deaths
aren't
due
to
drugs
like
co
caine
or
heroin
-
but
rather
pre
scrip
tion
drugs
In
2013
alone
over
doses
from
pre
scrip
tion
pain
med
i
ca
tions
killed
more
than
16,000
Amer
i
cans
And
most
young
peo
ple
who
be
gin
mis
us
ing
pre
scrip
tion
drugs
don't
buy
them
in
some
dark
al
ley
-
they
get
them
from
the
medicine
cab
i
net
If
that's
not
a
good
enough
rea
son
to
par
tic
i

in
"Na

here's
an
other
Many
pre
scrip

pain
med
i
ca

be
long
to
the
same
class
of
drugs
as
heroin
In
fact
four
in
five
heroin
users
started
out
by
mis
us
ing
pre
scrip
tion
drugs
And
over
the
course
of
just
one
year
be
tween
2013
and
2014
we
saw
a
33%
in
crease
in
the
num
ber
of
heroin
users
All
of
this
takes
a
ter
ri
ble
toll
on
too
many
fam
i
lies
in
too
many
com
mu
ni

all
across
the

-
big
and
small
ur
ban
and
ru

It
strains
law
en
force

and
treat

pro

It
costs
all
of

-
in
so
many
dif

That's

That's

Hi

One
of
the
things
that
makes
Amer

great
is
our
pas

for

-
that
spirit
of

One
of
the

of

Over

And
to

clean

from

or
the

is
ac
tu
ally
cheaper
in
many
com
mu

than
dirt

con

It's
helped
grow
our
econ

and
cut
our
to
tal
car
bon
pol
lu

more
than
any
other
coun
try
on

That
lead

ship
helped
bring
nearly
200
na

to

in
Paris
around
the
most
am
bi

in

And
in

we
also
launched
one
of
the

ever
as
sem

to

In

That's

As

That's

This
will

to

cre

more

faster
lower

And
while

many

And
I

Yes
ter
day
we
re
ceived
some
wel
come
news
on
that
front
We
learned
that
our
busi
nesses
added
nearly
250,000
new
jobs
last
month
The
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
fell
to
7.7%
--
still
too
high
but
now
lower
than
it
was
when
I
took
of
fice
Our
busi

have
cre
ated

ev

for
three
years
straight
--
nearly
6.4

new

Our

Our

New

are
be

built

sold
at
a
faster
pace
And
we
need
to
do
ev
ery
thing
we
can
to
keep
that
mo
men
tum
go

That
means
ask
ing
our
selves
three
ques
tions
ev
ery
day:
How
do
we
make
Amer
ica
a
mag
net
for
new
jobs?
How
do
we
equip
more
of
our
peo
ple
with
the
skills
those
jobs
re
quire?
And
how
do
we
make
sure
that
your
hard
work
leads
to
a
de
cent
liv
ing?
That
has
to
be
our
driv
ing
fo
cus
--
our
North
Star
And
at
a
time
when
our
busi

are
gain

a

more

the

That's

The

is,
Amer

is
a

of

That's
part

what

frankly
makes
our

some

messy
and
a

of

pretty

But
ul

mately
what

that
what

As

I'm

I've

want

And
I
ab

agree
that
the
only
way
we
'll
be
able
to
af
ford
the

we
need
is
if
we
cut
the
things
we
don't
and
live

our

But
I
refuse
to
cut

like
clean

that
will

An

an

Hi,
ev
ery
body
Just
in
time
for
the
hol
i
day
sea
son
we
now
have
an
other
piece
of
good
news
about
the
pace
of
our
eco
nomic
re
cov
ery
Last
month
our
busi
nesses
cre
ated
314,000
new
jobs
And
that's
not
a
fluke
-
it
keeps
up
the
solid
pace
of
job
cre
ation
we
've
seen
all
year
long
Novem
ber
was
the
tenth
month
in
a
row
we
've
added
more
than
200,000
jobs
So
far
this
year
our
econ
omy
has
cre
ated
2.65
mil
lion
new
jobs
That's
the
most
of
any
year
since
the
1990s
-
even
with
a
full
month
to
go.
All
told
our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
10.9
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
past
57
months
And
that's
the
long
est
streak
of
pri
vate
-
sec
tor
job
cre
ation
on
record
We
also
know
that
the
up
swing
in
job
growth
this
year
has
come
in
in
dus
tries
with
higher
wages
Over
all
wages
are
on
the
rise
And
that's
some
very
wel
come
news
for
mil
lions
of
hard

Amer

Be

even
though

time
highs
the
typ
i
cal
fam
ily
isn't
bring
ing
home
more
than
they
did
15
years
And
that
still
has
to
change
And
a
vi
brant
jobs
mar
ket
gives
us
the
op
por
tu
nity
to
keep
up
this
progress
and
be
gin
to
undo
that
decades
-
long
mid

But
first
we
need
the

Congress
to

A

not

Then
when

They

They

And

And
Congress

Hi,

In

Ad

I

Op

the
idea
at

heart

that

I

We

I
laid

will

It's
an

with

Re
cently
there
have
been
signs
that
the
econ
omy
is
pick
ing
up
steam
Last
month
we
saw
the
strong
est
job
growth
in
five
years
and
have
added
more
than
three
-
quar

of
a
mil
lion
pri

jobs
in
just

But
there
are
still
too
many
Amer

who
are

for

or
strug

to

keeps

Without
a
doubt
one
of
the
big
gest
bur
dens
over
the
last
few
months
has
been
the
price
of

In
many
places
gas
is
now
more
than
$4
a
gal

mean
ing
that
you
could
be
pay

more
than

Th

in

and
while
there
are
no
quick
fixes
to
the

there
are
a
few
steps
we
should
take
that
make

First
we
should
make

that
no

The

But
as
I've

many

Amer

The

Hello
ev

It's
been
al
most
three
weeks
since
I
sent
the
Amer

Jobs
Act
to
Congress
--
three
weeks
since
I
sent
them
a
bill
that
would
put
peo
ple
back
to
work
and
put
money
in
peo

pock

This
jobs

is
fully

This

con

the
kinds
of
pro
pos

that
Democrats
and
Repub

have
sup
ported
in
the
past
And
now
I
want
it
back
It's
time
for
Congress
to
get
its
act
to
gether
and
to
pass
this
jobs
bill
so
I
can
sign
it
into
Some
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
have
said
that
they
agree
with
cer
tain
parts
of
this
jobs
bill
If
so,
it's
time
for
them
to
tell
me
what
those
pro
pos
als
And
if
they
're
op
posed
to
this
jobs
bill
I'd
like
to
know
what
ex
actly
they
're
against
Are
they
against
putting
teach
ers
and
po
lice
of
fi
cers
and
fire
fight
ers
back
on
the
job?
Are
they
against
hir
ing
con
struc
tion
work
ers
to
re
build
our
roads
and
bridges
and
schools?
Are
they
against
giv
ing
tax
cuts
to
vir
tu
ally
ev
ery
worker
and
small
busi
ness
in
Amer
i
ca?
Economists
from
across
the
po
lit
i
cal
spec
trum
have
said
that
this
jobs
bill
would
boost
the
econ
omy
and
spur
hir

Why
would
you
be
against
that?
Espe
cially
at
a
time
when
so
many
Amer
i

are
strug
gling
and
out
of
work
This
isn't
just
about
what
I
think
is
right
It's
not
just
about
what
a
group
of
econ
o
mists
think
is
right
This
is
about
what
the
Amer

want
Every

I

they

And

That's

Hi,

To

I'm

On

And
that's

one
of
the
best
ways
to
grow
our
econ

is
to
sell
more
goods
and
ser

made
in
Amer
ica
to
the
rest
of
the
world
And
that
in
cludes
our
neigh

to
the
south
Right
over
40%
of
our
ex
ports
go
to
the
Amer
i
cas
And
those
ex
ports
are
grow
ing
faster
than
our
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
world
That's
why
I
vis

to

to

our

In

The
truth
is,
right
our

Mex

is
more

it's
been

We
've
put

il

by
nearly
80%
from

in

But
we
've

not

to

to

But
it's

It
