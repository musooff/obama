For now our first goal is to make Obama sing any song.
What we have done so far

1) 	Download all the videos of Obama, they usually have subtitles for all the speeches.
2)	We used CMU speech recognition to split every speech word by word.
	We can't listen to 50 minutes long speech. So since we have subtitles we splitted first videos into sentences.
	and then use speech recognition for each sentence and cut it word by word.
3)	With given all the word cuts we can produce any custom fake speech. You just give the text and does it like 10 seconds
	(Time taken is just for concatenating words and making new video clip)
4) 	We can make even Obama sing some songs
	Input is just Background Music and Song Lyrics (lrc format or srt like subtitle with timing of the each line)
5) We can put in obama talks in movies as well
	Input is just Movie and Subtitle

Issues we are facing now
1)	Audio glitches, how to remove them
2)	Pitch retification for different clips
	Even when I speed up or down the audio to fit the audio
3)	Not available words:
	our approach is
		1)	with CMU speech recognition making syllable model
			creating Syllable Language Model (In progress)
		2)	Any other approach, you can suggest?
4)	Two audio speech synchronization for getting best timing
5) 	Removing background music of the song so that I can use speech recognition for for the song and get word timing

That much for now
