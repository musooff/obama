% Name: smoothDownsampleFeature
% Date of Revision: 2011-03
% Programmer: Meinard Mueller, Sebastian Ewert
%
% Description:
% - Temporal smoothing and downsampling of a feature sequence
%
% Remark:
% - parameter.featureRate specifies the input feature rate. This value is
% used to derive the output feature rate.
%
% Input:
%         f_feature
%         parameter.winLenSmooth = 1;
%         parameter.downsampSmooth = 1;
%         parameter.inputFeatureRate = 0;
%
% Output:
%         f_feature
%         newFeatureRate
