% Name: test_convert_audio_to_pitchSTMSP.m
% Date of Revision: 2011-03
% Programmer: Meinard Mueller, Sebastian Ewert
%
% Description: 
% * Computes pitch subband decomposition of WAV file
%   (default: MIDI pitches 21 to 108) 
% * each pitch subband contains short time mean-square power (STMSP) 
% * Features are computed in a batch modus
% * Features are stored in folder 'data_feature/'
%
% Reference: 
% Details on the feature computation can be found in the following book:
