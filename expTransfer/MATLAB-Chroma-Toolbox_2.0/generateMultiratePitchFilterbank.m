% Generating filter bank of filters corresponding MIDI pitches

% Pitches 21-59, fs = 882
% Pitches 60-95, fs = 4410
% Pitches 96-120, fs =22050
%
% Q                  (center frequency) / bandwidt, Q > 30 separates notes
% stop:              pass_rel = 1/(2*Q); stop_rel = stop*pass_rel;
% Rp                 loses no more than Rp dB in the passband
% Rs                 attenuation in the stopband in dB
%
% For details to filter desgin use MATLAB help function
%                    e.g., "help ellipord" and "help ellip"
%
% Attention: Construction of [b,a] may fail if the
%                   filter specification are too restrictive
