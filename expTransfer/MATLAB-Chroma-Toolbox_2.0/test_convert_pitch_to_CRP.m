% Description: 
% * Computes CRP features (f_crp) from pitch features (f_pitch) 
% * CRP is a chroma-like feature tuned for timbre-invariance

% Reference: 
% Details on the feature computation can be found in the following articles:

% Meinard Mueller, Sebastian Ewert, and Sebastian Kreuzer
% Making chroma features more robust to timbre changes.
