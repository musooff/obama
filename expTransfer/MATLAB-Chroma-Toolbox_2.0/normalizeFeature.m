% Name: normalizeFeature
% Date of Revision: 2011-03
% Programmer: Meinard Mueller, Sebastian Ewert
%
% Description:
% - Normalizes a feature sequence according to the l^p norm
% - If the norm falls below threshold for a feature vector, then the
% normalized feature vector is set to be the unit vector.
%
% Input:
%         f_feature
%         normP
%         threshold
%
% Output:
%         f_featureNorm
