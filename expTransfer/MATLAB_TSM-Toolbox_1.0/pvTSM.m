% The phase vocoder is a time-scale modification algorithm. It rescales the
% time-axis of the input signal x according to the time-stretch function s
% without altering the pitch of x. The phase vocoder is particulary well
% suited for input signals of harmonic nature. For further details see the
% paper "Phase Vocoder" by Flanagan and Golden. Improvements to the basic
% phase vocoder technique, in particular a technique called 'identity phase
% locking' has been proposed in "Improved Phase Vocoder Time-Scale 
% Modification of Audio" by Laroche and Dolson and can optionally also be 
% used in this implementation.
