The

On
Fri

we
re

bet
ter
news
than
we
ex

about
the
state
of
our
econ

We
learned
that
we
lost
247,000
jobs
in
July
--
some
200,000
fewer
jobs
than
we
lost
in
June
and

fewer
than
the
nearly
700,000
a

we
were

at
the

of

Of

this
is

com

to
any
one
who
saw
their
job
dis
ap

in
July
and
to
the
mil
lions
of
Amer

who
are

And
I
will
not

un

any

Still
this

are
a
sign
that
we
've
be
gun
to
put
the
brakes
on
this
re
ces

and
that
the
worst
may
be

hind
us.
But
we
must
do
more
than
res
cue
our
econ

from
this

we
must

We

and

and
a

pil

of

is
health

re

--
re
form
that
we
are
now
closer
to

than
ever

There
are
still

There
are

But
we

In

to

what

So,
let

ex

what

will

for
And
let

start
by
dis
pelling
the

that

pro
mote

Med

or
bring

a

takeover

That's
sim
ply
not
true
This
isn't
about
putting
gov
ern
ment
in
charge
of
your
health
in
sur
ance;
it's
about
putting
you
in
charge
of
your
health
in

Un
der
the
re
forms
we
seek
if
you
like
your

tor
you
can
keep
your
doc
tor
If
you
like
your

plan
you
can
keep
your

And
while

is
ob
vi

es
sen

for

Amer

who

to

Right
we

a

that

for

that

I've

Your

and

it

With

In
the
the
de

about
health
in

re

boils
down
to
a
choice
be

two
ap

The

is
al

guar
an

to

That's
the
sta

That's
the
health

sys

we
have
right
So,
we
can
ei
ther
con
tinue
this
ap

or
we
can
choose
an
other
one
--
one
that
will

pro

and
bring

that

and

That's
the
health

sys

we
can
bring

with

There
are
those
who
are
fo

on

called

of

who
are
try

And
that's

That's
Wash
ing

But
let's
never

get
that
this
isn't
about

This
is
about
peo

This
is
about

This

about

That's
what's
at

And
that's
why
health

That's
why
we

my

is
the

And
in

we
need
to

both
to

But
to

--
Sun
day
at
mid

--
some
im
por
tant

we
use
against
ter

That's
be
cause
Congress
has
not
re

them
and
be
cause
leg
is
la

that
would
--
the
USA
Free

Act
--
is
stuck
in
the
Se

I
want
to
be
very
clear
about
what
this
means
To

when
in

Our

can
seek

We

called

--
sus

ter

who
may
not
be
di
rectly

to
a

Th
ese

are
not
con
tro
ver

Since
9/11
they
have
been
re

nu
mer
ous
times
FBI
Direc

James
Comey
says
they
are
"essen

and
that

But
if
Congress
doesn't
act
by
to
mor
row
at
mid
night
these
tools
go
away
as
well
The
USA
Free

Act
also
ac
com
plishes
some
thing
I
called
for
a
year
and
a
half
ago:
it
ends
the
bulk
meta
data
pro

--
the
bulk
col
lec

of
phone

--
as
it
cur
rently
ex

and
puts
in
place
new
re

The
gov
ern
ment
will
no
longer
hold
these
records;
tele
phone
providers
will
The
Act
also
in
cludes
other
changes
to
our
sur
veil

--
in
clud
ing
more
trans

--
to
help
build
con

among
the

peo

that

But
if
Congress
doesn't
act
by

to

these

will
be

It
doesn't

The

The
Pres
i
dent:
Hi,
ev
ery
body
On
Thurs
day
I
ad
dressed
a
con
fer
ence
for
busi
ness
lead
ers
from
around
the
world
And
my
pitch
was
sim
ple:
Choose
Amer
ica
In
vest
in
Amer
ica
Create
jobs
in
Amer
ica
It
speaks
to
my
top
pri
or
ity
as
Pres
i
dent:
grow
ing
our
econ
omy
cre
at
ing
good
jobs
strength
en
ing
se
cu
rity
and
op
por
tu
nity
for
the
mid
dle
class
Over
the
past
three
and
a
half
years
our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
over
seven
and
a
half
mil
lion
new
jobs
And
this
week
the
Trea
sury
con
firmed
that
since
I
took
of
fice
we
've
cut
our
deficits
by
more
than
half
But
we
have
more
work
to
do.
We
need
to
grow
and
cre
ate
more
good
jobs
faster
That's
my
driv
ing
fo
cus
And
I'll
go
any
where
and
do
any
thing
to
make
it
hap
pen
That
has
to
be
Wash
ing
ton's
driv
ing
fo
cus
as
well
But
I
know
that
what
you
of
ten
hear
out
of
Wash
ing
ton
can
sound
like
Char
lie
Brown's
teacher
-
a
jum
ble
of
un
fo
cused
noise
that's
out
of
touch
with
the
things
you
care
about
So
to
day
I
want
to
cut
through
that
noise
and
talk
plainly
about
what
we
should
do
right
now
to
keep
grow
ing
this
econ
omy
and
cre
at
ing
new
jobs
It
be
gins
by
end
ing
what
has
done
more
than
any
thing
else
to
un
der
mine
our
econ
omy
over
the
past
few
years
-
and
that's
the
con
stant
cy
cle
of
man
u
fac
tured
crises
and
self
-
in
flicted
wounds
I
was
glad
to
hear
the
Repub
li
can
leader
in
the
Se
nate
say
this
week
that
they
won't
pur
sue
an
other
gov
ern
ment
shut
down
or
threaten
an
other
de
fault
on
our
debt
Be
cause
we
shouldn't
be
in
jur
ing
our
selves
ev
ery
few
months
-
we
should
be
in
vest
ing
in
our
selves
And
one
way
to
do
that
is
through
the
bud
get
that
Congress
started
work
ing
on
this
week
bud
gets
can
be
a
bor
ing
topic
-
es
pe
cially
on
the
week
end
But
they
can
also
be
re
veal
ing
Be
cause
they
ex
pose
what
our
pri
or
i
ties
are
as
a
coun
try
for
all
to
Think
about
it.
We
can
keep
waste
ful
cor
po
rate
tax
give
aways
that
work
ing
folks
don't
get
-
or
we
could
close
those
loop
holes
and
use
that
money
to
pay
for
things
that
ac
tu
ally
cre
ate
jobs
We
can
keep
harm
ful
cuts
to
ed
u
ca
tion
pro
grams
-
or
we
could
give
more
kids
a
head
start
hire
more
teach
ers
in
math
and
sci
ence
and
help
more
kids
af
ford
a
col
lege
ed
u

We
can
keep
dol
ing
out
cor
po
rate

to
big

com

-
or
we
could
keep
in
vest

in
the

that
cre

and
low

our
car
bon

Pri
or
i

Choices
That's
what
this
is
about
And
the
stakes
for
the
mid
dle
class
couldn't
be
higher
If
we
don't
pick
the
right
pri
or
i
ties
make
the
right
choices
we
could
hin
der
growth
and
op
por
tu
nity
for
decades
and
leave
our
chil
dren
with
some
thing
less
That
in
cludes
the
ob
ses
sion
with
cut
ting
just
for
the
sake
of
cut
ting
That
hasn't
helped
our
econ
omy
grow;
it's
held
it
back
Re
mem
ber
our
deficits
are
get
ting
smaller
-
not
big
ger
On
my
watch
they
're
fall
ing
at
the
fastest
pace
in
60
years
So
that
gives
us
room
to
fix
our
long
-
term
debt
prob
lems
with
out
stick
ing
it
to
young
peo
ple
or
un

our

re

and

se
cu

pro
grams
or
cut
ting
ba
sic
re
search
that
helps
the
econ
omy
grow
Here's
the
bot
tom
line
Congress
should
pass
a
bud
get
that
cuts
things
we
don't
need
and
closes
waste
ful
tax
loop
holes
that
don't
help
cre
ate
jobs
so
that
we
can
free
up
re
sources
for
the
things
that
ac
tu
ally
do
cre
ate
jobs
and
growth
Build
ing
new
roads
and
bridges
and
schools
and
air
ports
-
that
cre
ates
jobs
Ed
u
cat
ing
our
kids
and
our
work

for
a
global
econ
omy
-
that
helps
us
grow
In
vest
ing
in
sci
ence
tech
nol
ogy
and
re
search
-
that
keeps
our
busi
nesses
and
our
mil
i
tary
on
the
cut
ting
edge
It's
vi
tal
for
our
eco
nomic
fu
ture
So
the
ques
tion
isn't
be
tween
growth
and
fis
cal
re
spon
si
bil
ity
We
need
both
The
ques
tion
can't
be
how
much
more
we
can
cut;
it's
got
to
be
how
many
more
jobs
we
can
cre
ate
how
many
more
kids
we
can

u
cate
and
how
much
more

pros

we
can

Be
cause
in
Amer
ica
our
econ
omy
doesn't
grow
from
the
top
-
down
It
grows
from
the
mid
dle
-
class
And
as
long
as
I
am
Pres
i

our
na

mis

will
re

build

an
Amer

where
ev

has

to

Thanks
and
have
a

The
Pres
i
dent:
I've
spent
some
time
lately
trav
el
ing
the
coun
try
and
talk
ing
with
folks
out
side
of
Wash
ing
ton
And
the
num
ber
one
is
sue
for
the
peo
ple
I
meet
is
how
we
can
get
back
to
a
place
where
we
're
cre
at
ing
good
mid
dle
-
class
jobs
that
pay
well
and
of
fer
some
se
cu
rity
That's
the
idea
be
hind
the
Amer
i
can
Jobs
It's
a
jobs
bill
that
does
two
sim
ple
things:
put
more
peo
ple
back
to
work
and
more
money
back
in
the
pock
ets
of
peo
ple
who
are
work
ing
This
jobs
bill
puts
con
struc
tion
work
ers
back
to
work
re
build
ing
our
roads
and
bridges
and
mod
ern
iz
ing
our
schools
This
jobs
bill
puts
teach
ers
back
in
the
class
room
and
keeps
cops
and
fire
fight
ers
on
our
streets
This
jobs
bill
gives
tax
cred
its
to
com
pa
nies
that
hire
our
vet
er
ans
be
cause
if
you
sign
up
to
fight
for
our
coun
try
the
last
thing
you
should
have
to
do
is
fight
for
a
job
when
you
come
home
This
jobs
bill
con
nects
the
long
-
term
un
em
ployed
to
tem
po
rary
work
to
keep
their
skills
sharp
while
they
look
for
a
and
it
gives
hun
dreds
of
thou
sands
of
young
peo
ple
the
hope
of
a
job
next
sum
mer
This
jobs
bill
cuts
taxes
for
ev
ery
small
busi
ness
owner
in
Amer
ica
It
cuts
them
even
more
for
small
busi
ness
own
ers
that
hire
new
work
ers
and
raise
work
ers
salaries
And
it
cuts
taxes
for
ev
ery
work
ing
fam
ily
in
Amer
ica
so
that
you
'll
have
more
money
in
your
pock
ets
and
busi
nesses
know
they
'll
have
more
cus
tomers
to
buy
what
they
sell
That's
the
Amer
i
can
Jobs
and
you
can
check
it
out
for
your
self
on
WhiteHousegov
It
will
cre
ate
new
jobs
It
'll
cut
taxes
for
ev
ery
worker
and
small
busi
ness
in
the
coun
try
And
it
will
not
add
to
the
deficit
It
will
be
paid
On
Mon
day
I'll
lay
out
my
plan
for
how
we
'll
do
that
--
how
we
'll
pay
for
this
plan
and
pay
down
our
debt
by
fol
low
ing
some
ba
sic
prin
ci
ples:
mak
ing
sure
we
live
within
our
means
and
ask
ing
ev
ery
one
to
pay
their
fair
share
But
right
we
've
got
to
get
Congress
to
pass
this
jobs
bill
Every
thing
in
the
Amer
i
can
Jobs
Act
is
the
kind
of
idea
that's
been
sup
ported
by
Democrats
and
Repub
li
cans
be
fore
And
if
they
're
ideas
you
agree
with
then
ev
ery
one
of
you
can
help
make
it
hap
pen
by
telling
your
con
gressper
son
to
pass
this
jobs
bill
right
away
I
know
some
of
them
would
rather
wait
an
other
year
to
wage
an
other
elec
tion
than
work
to
gether
right
But
most
Amer
i
cans
don't
have
the
lux
ury
of
wait
ing
It
was
three
years
ago
this
week
that
a
fi
nan
cial
cri

on
Wall
Street
made
things
much
more
dif
fi
cult
for
work
ing
folks
on
Main

And
too
many
are
still
hurt
ing
as
a
re

So
the
time
for
ac
tion
is
No
more
games
No
more
grid
lock
No
more
di
vi
sion
or
de
lay
It's
time
for
the
peo

you
sent
to
Wash
ing

to
put
coun

be
fore
party
--
to
stop
wor
ry
ing
so
much
about
their
jobs
and
start
wor

more
about
yours
It's
time
to
get
to
work
and
show
the

once
again
why

Thanks
The
Pres
i
dent:
Over
the
last
few
months
I've
been
talk
ing
about
a
choice
we
face
as
a
coun
try
We
can
ei
ther
set
tle
for
an
econ
omy
where
a
few
peo
ple
do
re
ally
well
and
ev
ery
body
else
strug
gles
to
get
by,
or
we
can
build
an
econ
omy
where
hard
work
pays
off
again
Where
ev
ery
one
gets
a
fair
shot
Every
one
does
their
fair
share
And
ev
ery
one
plays
by
the
same
rules
That's
up
to
us.
And
to
day
I
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
idea
that
ev
ery
one
in
this
coun
try
should
do
their
fair
share
if
this
were
a
per
fect
world
we'd
have
un
lim
ited
re
sources
--
no
one
would
ever
have
to
pay
any
taxes
and
we
could
spend
as
much
as
we
wanted
But
we
live
in
the
real
world
--
we
don't
have
un
lim
ited
re
sources
We
have
a
deficit
that
needs
to
be
paid
down
And
we
also
have
to
pay
for
in
vest
ments
that
will
help
our
econ
omy
grow
and
keep
our
coun
try
safe:
Ed
u
ca
tion;
re
search
and
tech
nol
o
gy;
a
strong
mil
i
tary;
and
re
tire
ment
pro
grams
like
Medi
care
and
So
cial
Se
cu
rity
That
means
we
have
to
make
choices
When
it
comes
to
pay
ing
down
the
deficit
and
in
vest
ing
in
our
fu
ture
should
we
ask
mid
dle
-
class
Amer
i
cans
to
pay

is
at
the

--
pa

Democrats
and
Repub

cans
alike
A
few

some
of
these
im
prob
a
ble
al
lies
com
mit
ted
to
cut
na
tional
health
care
spend
ing
by
two
tril
lion
dol
lars
over
the
next
decade
What
makes
this
so
re
mark
able
is
that
it
prob
a
bly
wouldn't
have
hap
pened
just
a
few
short
years
But
to
day
at
this
his
toric
junc
ture
even
old
ad
ver
saries
are
united
around
the
same
goal:
qual
ity
af
ford
able
health
care
for
all
Amer
i
cans
I
know
that
when
you
bring
to
gether
dis
parate
groups
with
dif
fer
ing
views
there
will
be
lively
de
bate
And
that's
a
de
bate
I
wel
come
But
what
we
can't
ac
cept
is
re
form
that
just
in
vests
more
money
in
the
sta
tus
quo
--
re
form
that
throws
good
money
af
ter
bad
habits
In
stead
we
must
at
tack
the
root
causes
of
sky
rock
et
ing
health
care
costs
some
of
these
costs
are
the
re
sult
of
un
war
ranted
prof
i
teer
ing
that
has
no
place
in
our
health
care
sys
tem
and
in
too
many
com
mu
ni
ties
folks
are
pay
ing
higher
costs
with
out
re
ceiv
ing
bet
ter
care
in
re
turn
And
yet
we
know
for
ex
am
ple
that
there
are
places
like
the
Mayo
Clinic
in
Min
nesota
the
Cleve
land
Clinic
in
Ohio
and
other
in
sti
tu
tions
that
of
fer
some
of
the
high
est
qual
ity
of
care
in
the
na
tion
at
some
of
the
low
est
costs
in
the
na
tion
We
should
learn
from
their
suc
cesses
and
pro
mote
the
best
prac
tices
not
the
most
ex
pen
sive
ones
That's
how
we
'll
achieve
re
form
that
fixes
what
doesn't
work
and
builds
on
what
does
This
week
I
con
veyed
to
Congress
my
be
lief
that
any
health
care
re
form
must
be
built
around
fun
da
men
tal
re
forms
that
lower
costs
im
prove
qual
ity
and
cov
er
age
and
also
pro
tect
con
sumer
choice
And
that
means
if
you
like
the
plan
you
have
you
can
keep
it.
If
you
like
the
doc
tor
you
have
you
can
keep
your
doc
tor
The
only
change
you
'll
see
are
fall
ing
costs
as
our
re
forms
take
hold
I've
also
made
it
very
clear
to
Congress
that
we
must
de
velop
a
plan
that
doesn't
add
to
our
bud
get
deficit
My
bud
get
in
cluded
a
his
toric
down
pay
ment
on
re
form
and
we
'll
work
with
Congress
to
fully
cover
the
costs
through
rig
or
ous
spend
ing
re
duc

and
ap
pro

We
'll
elim
i
nate
waste
fraud
and
abuse
in
our
health

we
'll
also

Judge

grew

with

As

For

-

On

A

But
at

when

of

seem

this
is

Be

not

And
it

So
I
ask

in

to
give
Judge

the

he
has
earned
Give

Give

To

To

it

I

Now

They

And

when

who

This

So
I
con

all
this

--
Repub

and
In

But
the
cam

sea

is
over
And
it's
time
to
fo
cus
on
our
shared
re
spon
si
bil
i

to
work
to
gether
and
de
liver
those
re

speed
ing
up
our
eco

re
cov

cre
at
ing
jobs
and
strength
en
ing
the
mid
dle
class
so
that
the
Amer
i
can
Dream
feels
like
it's
back
within
reach
That's
why
I've
asked
to
sit
down
soon
with
lead
ers
of
both
par
ties
so
that
we
can
have
an
ex
tended
dis
cus
sion
about
what
we
can
do
to
gether
to
move
this
coun
try
for
ward
And
over
the
next
few
weeks
we
're
go
ing
to
have
a
chance
to
work
to
gether
in
the
brief
up
com
ing
ses
sion
of
Congress
Here's
why
this
lame
-
duck
ses
sion
is
so
im
por
tant
Early
in
the
last
decade
Pres
i
dent
Bush
and
Congress
en
acted
a
se
ries
of
tax
cuts
that
were
de
signed
to
ex
pire
at
the
end
of
this
year
What
that
means
is,
if
Congress
doesn't
act
by
New
Year's
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
will
see
their
taxes
go
up
start
ing
on
New
Year's
But
the
last
thing
we
should
do
is
raise
taxes
on
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
For
the
past
decade
they
saw
their
costs
rise
their
in
comes
fall
and
too
many
jobs
go
over
seas
They
're
the
ones
bear
ing
the
brunt
of
the
re
ces
sion
They
're
the
ones
hav
ing
trou
ble
mak
ing
ends
meet
They
're
the
ones
who
need
re
lief
right
So
some
thing's
got
to
be
done
And
I
be
lieve
there's
room
for
us
to
com
pro
mise
and
get
it
done
to
gether
Let's
start
where
we
agree
All
of
us
want
cer
tainty
for
mid
dle
-
class
Amer
i
cans
None
of
us
want
them
to
wake
up
on
Jan
uary
1st
with
a
higher
tax
bill
And
that's
why
I
be
lieve
we
should
per
ma
nently
ex
tend
the
Bush
tax
cuts
for
all
fam
i
lies
mak
ing
less
than
$250,000
a
year
That's
98%
of
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
We
also
agree
on
the
need
to
start
cut
ting
spend
ing
and
bring
ing
down
our
deficit
That's
go
ing
to
re
quire
ev
ery
one
to
make
some
tough
choices
In
fact
if
Congress
were
to
im
ple
ment
my
pro
posal
to
freeze
non
-
se
cu
rity
dis
cre
tionary
spend
ing
for
three
years
it
would
bring
this
spend
ing
down
to

this

it

noth

The

Right
there's
a
big
de
bate
tak
ing
place
in
Wash
ing
ton
that
'll
af
fect
how
much
you
pay
in
taxes
next

If
Congress
doesn't

will

go

$3,000
That's
un
ac
cept
able
to
me.
Not
when
we
know
that
it's
the
mid
dle
class
that
was
hit
the
hard
est
by
the
re
ces
sion
And
not
when
we
know
that
tak
ing
this
money
out
of
the
pock
ets
of
work
ing
peo
ple
is
ex
actly
the
wrong
thing
to
do
to
get
our
econ
omy
grow
ing
faster
Economists
tell
us
that
this
tax
hike
on
work
ing
fam
i
lies
would
ac
tu
ally
cost
us
well
over
a
mil
lion
jobs
That's
why
I've
been
fight
ing
so
hard
to
cut
mid
dle
class
taxes
And
that's
why
I
brought
both
Democrats
and
Repub
li
cans
to
the
ta
ble
--
to
put
to
gether
a
com
pro
mise
and
work
through
our
dif
fer
ences
so
we
could
get
this
done
Repub

in
Congress
strongly
fa
vored
per
ma

tax
breaks
for
the

i
est
tax

and
the
wealth
i
est
es
tates
most
of
which
would
go
to
mil
lion
aires
and
even
bil
lion
aires
I
didn't
be
lieve
that
these
tax
cuts
were
worth
the
cost
They'd
add
to
our
deficits
with
out
re
ally
boost
ing
the
econ
omy
I
be
lieved
in
stead
that
the
best
way
to
help
the
econ
omy
and
work
ing
fam
i
lies
was
to
keep
mid
dle
class
tax
rates
and
cut
taxes
for
work
ing
par
ents
col
lege
stu
dents
and
small
busi
nesses
And
I
be
lieved
that
with
mil
lions
of
peo
ple
look
ing
for
jobs
it
would
be
a
ter
ri
ble
mis
take
to
end
un
em

ment
in
sur
ance
--
not
only
for
peo
ple
who
are
out
of
work
but
for
our
en
tire
econ
omy
So
we
ham
mered
out
a
deal
that
re
flects
ideas
from
both
sides
It
wasn't
easy
and
it's
by
no
means
per
fect
And
as
with
any
com
pro
mise
ev
ery
body
had
to
live
with
el
e

they
didn't
like
But
this
is
a
good
deal
for
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
The
vast
ma
jor
ity
of
the
tax
cuts
in
this
plan
will
help
the
mid

in
clud
ing
a
new
cut
in
pay
roll
taxes
that
will
save
the
av
er
age
fam
ily
about
$1,000
And
as
this
plan
is
de
bated
in
Congress
what
I
want
to
make
clear
is
the
real
dif
fer
ence
it
will
make
in
peo
ple's
lives
It's
go
ing
to
make
a
dif
fer
ence
for
a
sin
gle
mom
with
two
kids
in
Ohio
work
ing
as
a
cashier
With
this
plan
she'd
get
a
new
pay
roll
tax
cut
and
a
big
ger
child
tax
credit
to
gether
worth
more
than
$2,300
It's
go
ing
to
make
a
dif

ence
for
a
cou
ple
in
Florida
earn
ing
about
$50,000
and
try
ing
to
put
one
of
their
two
kids
through

They'd
save
more
than
$4,000
be
cause
the
mid

tax
cuts
--
in
clud
ing
a
$2,500

And
it's
go
ing
to
make
an
enor

For
many
of

And
I'd

it
will
also
hurt

which
will

are
not
just
go
ing
to
take
Rus

and
As
sad's
word
for
it.
We
need
to
see
con

to
demon
strate
that
As
sad
is
se
ri

about
giv

And
since
this
plan
emerged
only
with
a

threat
of

we
will
main
tain
our
mil

in
the
re

to
keep

As

And
if

the
United

and
the

must

The

of

any

in
the

is
an

to

and
a
threat
to

of

ev

where
As
I
have
said
for

the

A

And
we

be

the

of

for

We
have
a
duty
to
pre
serve
a

free
from

But

I

Thank
The
Pres
i

Hi,
ev
ery
body
I'm
here
in
Ohio
where
I've
spent
the
past
cou
ple
of
days
talk
ing
with
folks
about
our
cen
tral
chal
lenge
as
a
coun
try
--
not
just
re
claim
ing
all
the
jobs
lost
to
the
re
ces
sion
but
re
claim
ing
the
eco
nomic
se
cu
rity
that
so
many
Amer
i
cans
have
lost
over
the
last
decade
Our
mis
sion
isn't
just
to
put
peo
ple
back
to
work
--
it's
to
re
build
an
econ
omy
where
that
work
pays;
an
econ
omy
in
which
ev
ery
one
who
works
hard
has
the
chance
to
get
ahead
For
months
we
've
been
push
ing
Congress
to
pass
sev
eral
com
mon
-
sense
ideas
that
will
help
us
do
that
And
on
Fri
day
I
signed
into
law
a
bill
that
will
do
two
things
for
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
First
it
will
keep
thou
sands
of
con
struc
tion
work
ers
on
the
job
re
build
ing
our
na
tion's
in
fra
struc
ture
Se
cond
it
will
keep
in
ter
est
rates
on
fed
eral
stu
dent
loans
from
dou
bling
this
year
--
which
would
have
hit
more
than
seven
mil
lion
stu
dents
with
about
a
thou
sand
dol
lars
more
on
their
loan
pay
ments
Those
steps
will
make
a
real
dif
fer
ence
in
the
lives
of
mil
lions
of
Amer
i
cans
But
make
no
mis
take:
we
've
got
more
to
do.
The
con
struc
tion
in
dus
try
was
hit
bru
tally
hard
when
the
hous
ing
bub
ble
burst
So
it's
not
enough
to
just
keep
con
struc
tion
work
ers
on
the
job
do
ing
projects
that
were
al
ready
un
der
way
For
months
I've
been
call
ing
on
Congress
to
take
half
the
money
we
're
no
longer
spend
ing
on
war
and
use
it
to
do
some
na
tion
-
build
ing
here
at
home
There's
work
to
be
done
build
ing
roads
and
bridges
and
wire
less
net
works
And
there
are
hun
dreds
of
thou
sands
of
con
struc
tion
work
ers
ready
to
do
it.
The
same
thing
is
true
for
our
stu
dents
The
bill
I'm
about
to
sign
is
vi
tal
for
mil
lions
of
stu
dents
and
their
fam
i
lies
But
it's
not
enough
to
just
keep
their
stu
dent
loan
rates
from
dou
bling
For
months
I've
been
call
ing
on
Congress
to
re
form
and
ex
pand
the
fi
nan
cial
aid
that's
of
fered
to
stu
dents
I've
been
ask
ing
them
to
help
us
give
two
mil
lion
Amer
i
cans
the
op
por
tu
nity
to
learn
the
skills
that
busi

in
their

are

for
--
right
now
--
through

be

In

It's

Hello
from
the
Coun
try
Corner
Farm
in
Al
pha
Illi
nois
For
the
past
few
days
I've
been
trav
el
ing
to
small
towns
and
farm
towns
here
in
the
heart
land
of
this
coun
try
I
sat
down
with
small
busi
ness
own
ers
in
Gut
ten
berg
Iowa
and
ranch
ers
and
farm
ers
in
Peosta
I
had
lunch
with
vet
er
ans
in
Can
non
Falls
Min
nesota
and
talked
to
plant
work
ers
at
a
seed
dis
trib
u
tor
in
Atkin
son
Illi
nois
And
to
the
girls
vol
ley
ball
team
and
Maquoketa
High
School
let
me
just
say
one
thing
--
go
Car
di
nals!
I'm
out
here
for
one
rea
son
--
I
think
Wash
ing
ton
can
learn
some
thing
from
the
folks
in
Atkin
son
and
Peosta
and
Can
non
Falls
I
think
our
coun
try
would
be
a
whole
lot
bet
ter
off
if
our
elected
lead
ers
showed
the
same
kind
of
dis
ci
pline
and
in
tegrity
and
re
spon
si
bil
ity
that
most
Amer
i
cans
demon
strate
in
their
lives
ev
ery
sin
gle
Be
cause
the
fact
is,
we
're
go
ing
through
a
tough
time
right
We
're
com
ing
through
a
ter
ri
ble
re
ces
sion
--
a
lot
of
folks
are
still
look
ing
for
work
A
lot
of
peo
ple
are
get
ting
by
with
smaller
pay
checks
or
less
money
in
the
cash
reg
is
ter
So
we
need
folks
in
Wash
ing
ton
--
the
peo
ple
whose
job
it
is
to
deal
with
the
coun
try's
prob
lems
the
peo
ple
who
you
elected
to
serve
--
we
need
them
to
put
aside
their
dif
fer
ences
to
get
things
done
There
are
things
we
can
do
right
now
that
will
mean
more
cus
tomers
for
busi
nesses
and
more
jobs
across
the
coun
try
We
can
cut
pay
roll
taxes
again
so
fam
i
lies
have
an
ex
tra
thou
sand
dol
lars
to
spend
We
can
pass
a
road
con
struc
tion
bill
so
con
struc
tion
crews
who
are
now
sit
ting
idle
can
head
back
to
the
work
site
re
build
ing
roads
and
bridges
and
air
ports
We
've
got
brave
skilled
Amer
i
cans
re
turn
ing
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Let's
con
nect
them
with
busi
nesses
that
could
use
their
skills
And
let's
pass
trade
deals
to
level
the
play
ing
field
for
our
busi
nesses
We
have
Amer
i
cans
driv
ing
Hyundais
and
Kias
--
well
I
want
to
see
folks
in
Korea
driv

Fords
Chevys
and
Chryslers
I
want
more
prod
ucts
sold
around
the
globe
stamped
with
three
words
--
"Made
in
Amer
i
ca."
Th
ese
are
com
mon
sense
ideas
--
ideas
that
have
been
sup
ported
by
both
Democrats
and
Repub
li
cans
The
only
thing
hold
ing
them
back
is
pol
i
tics
The
only
thing
pre
vent
ing
us
from
pass
ing
these
bills
is
the
re
fusal
by
some
in
Congress
to
put
coun
try
ahead
of
party
That's
the
prob
lem
we
have
right
That's
what's
hold
ing
this
coun
try
back
That's
what
we
have
to
change
Be
cause
for
all
the
knocks
we
've
taken
de
spite
all
the
chal
lenges
we
face
this
is
still
the
great
est
coun

on
Earth
We
still
have
the
best
work

farm

en
trepreneurs
and
busi

stu

and
sci

And
you
can
see
that
here
in
Al

You
can
see
it
along
the
coun

roads
that
con

You

Get
