00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.667
(applause)

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.066
The President:
Thank you.

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.867
Thank you.

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:07.000
Everybody, please be seated.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.500
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice
President, members of Congress,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.700
distinguished guests,
and fellow Americans:

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.667
Last month, I went to Andrews
Air Force Base and welcomed home

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:28.133
some of our last troops
to serve in Iraq.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:32.333
Together, we offered a final,
proud salute to the colors under

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:36.500
which more than a million of
our fellow citizens fought --

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.734
and several thousand
gave their lives.

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:46.000
We gather tonight knowing that
this generation of heroes has

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.166
made the United States safer and
more respected around the world.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:01:12.333
(applause)

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.700
For the first time
in nine years,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.800
there are no Americans
fighting in Iraq.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.433
(applause)

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.900
For the first time
in two decades,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.800
Osama bin Laden is not a
threat to this country.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:47.400
(cheering and applause)

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.767
Most of al Qaeda's top
lieutenants have been defeated.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:55.000
The Taliban's momentum
has been broken,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.800
and some troops in Afghanistan
have begun to come home.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.400
These achievements are a
testament to the courage,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.233
selflessness and teamwork
of America's Armed Forces.

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:15.567
At a time when too many of our
institutions have let us down,

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:19.433
they exceed all expectations.

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:22.767
They're not consumed
with personal ambition.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:26.533
They don't obsess over
their differences.

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:30.300
They focus on the
mission at hand.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.600
They work together.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.000
Imagine what we could accomplish
if we followed their example.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.800
(applause)

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.600
Think about the America
within our reach:

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.133
A country that leads the
world in educating its people.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:58.200
An America that attracts a
new generation of high-tech

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.667
manufacturing and
high-paying jobs.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.900
A future where we're in
control of our own energy,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.100
and our security and prosperity
aren't so tied to unstable parts

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.233
of the world.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:15.834
An economy built to last,
where hard work pays off,

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:20.100
and responsibility is rewarded.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.100
We can do this.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.200
I know we can, because
we've done it before.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.166
At the end of World War II, when
another generation of heroes

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:34.934
returned home from combat, they
built the strongest economy and

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:37.166
middle class the
world has ever known.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:44.533
(applause)

00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:48.100
My grandfather, a
veteran of Patton's Army,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.266
got the chance to go to
college on the GI Bill.

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.900
My grandmother, who worked
on a bomber assembly line,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.567
was part of a workforce
that turned out the best

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:01.700
products on Earth.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.567
The two of them shared the
optimism of a nation that had

00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:09.834
triumphed over a
depression and fascism.

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:12.533
They understood they were
part of something larger;

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:16.700
that they were contributing to
a story of success that every

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.300
American had a
chance to share --

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.367
the basic American promise
that if you worked hard,

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:28.367
you could do well enough to
raise a family, own a home,

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:31.066
send your kids to college,
and put a little away

00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:34.767
for retirement.

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:38.500
The defining issue of our
time is how to keep that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.467
promise alive.

00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:44.600
No challenge is more urgent.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.467
No debate is more important.

00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:51.100
We can either settle for a
country where a shrinking number

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.533
of people do really well while
a growing number of Americans

00:04:54.533 --> 00:05:00.333
barely get by, or we can restore
an economy where everyone gets a

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:03.433
fair shot, and everyone
does their fair share,

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:06.000
and everyone plays by
the same set of rules.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:21.600
(applause)

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.734
What's at stake aren't
Democratic values or Republican

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:29.400
values, but American values.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.266
And we have to reclaim them.

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:37.166
Let's remember how we got here.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:40.567
Long before the recession,
jobs and manufacturing began

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:42.967
leaving our shores.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.233
Technology made
businesses more efficient,

00:05:45.233 --> 00:05:48.734
but also made some
jobs obsolete.

00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:52.800
Folks at the top saw their
incomes rise like never before,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.433
but most hardworking Americans
struggled with costs that were

00:05:55.433 --> 00:06:00.100
growing, paychecks that weren't,
and personal debt that kept

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.700
piling up.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.600
In 2008, the house
of cards collapsed.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.834
We learned that mortgages had
been sold to people who couldn't

00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:13.900
afford or understand them.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.900
Banks had made huge bets
and bonuses with other

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.667
people's money.

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:21.800
Regulators had
looked the other way,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.934
or didn't have the authority
to stop the bad behavior.

00:06:26.934 --> 00:06:29.000
It was wrong.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.467
It was irresponsible.

00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:35.000
And it plunged our economy into
a crisis that put millions out

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.900
of work, saddled us with
more debt, and left innocent,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.867
hardworking Americans
holding the bag.

00:06:42.867 --> 00:06:44.800
In the six months
before I took office,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.066
we lost nearly 4 million jobs.

00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:51.467
And we lost another 4 million
before our policies were in

00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:54.200
full effect.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.934
Those are the facts.

00:06:57.934 --> 00:07:01.600
But so are these: In
the last 22 months,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.133
businesses have created
more than 3 million jobs.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:22.433
(applause)

00:07:22.433 --> 00:07:28.200
Last year, they created
the most jobs since 2005.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.700
American manufacturers
are hiring again,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.100
creating jobs for the first
time since the late 1990s.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.333
Together, we've agreed to
cut the deficit by more than

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.767
$2 trillion.

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:44.300
And we've put in place new rules
to hold Wall Street accountable,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.500
so a crisis like this
never happens again.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:56.467
(applause)

00:07:56.467 --> 00:08:00.100
The state of our Union
is getting stronger.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.700
And we've come too
far to turn back now.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.734
As long as I'm President, I will
work with anyone in this chamber

00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:10.633
to build on this momentum.

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:13.266
But I intend to fight
obstruction with action,

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:17.533
and I will oppose any effort to
return to the very same policies

00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:19.834
that brought on this economic
crisis in the first place.

00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:36.734
(cheering and applause)

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:42.800
No, we will not go back to an
economy weakened by outsourcing,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.900
bad debt, and phony
financial profits.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.934
Tonight, I want to speak
about how we move forward,

00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:54.133
and lay out a blueprint for an
economy that's built to last --

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:59.300
an economy built on American
manufacturing, American energy,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.467
skills for American workers, and
a renewal of American values.

00:09:04.467 --> 00:09:11.367
Now, this blueprint begins
with American manufacturing.

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:15.000
On the day I took office, our
auto industry was on the verge

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.066
of collapse.

00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:20.433
Some even said we
should let it die.

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:23.400
With a million jobs at stake,
I refused to let that happen.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.967
In exchange for help, we
demanded responsibility.

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:32.567
We got workers and automakers
to settle their differences.

00:09:32.567 --> 00:09:36.400
We got the industry to
retool and restructure.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.900
Today, General Motors is
back on top as the world's

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.600
number-one automaker.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:56.700
(cheering and applause)

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.600
Chrysler has grown faster in the
U.S. than any major car company.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.967
Ford is investing billions
in U.S. plants and factories.

00:10:05.967 --> 00:10:08.533
And together, the entire
industry added nearly

00:10:08.533 --> 00:10:12.767
160,000 jobs.

00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:15.166
We bet on American workers.

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:17.367
We bet on American ingenuity.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.934
And tonight, the American
auto industry is back.

00:10:20.934 --> 00:10:34.734
(applause)

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:40.467
What's happening in Detroit
can happen in other industries.

00:10:40.467 --> 00:10:45.400
It can happen in Cleveland
and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.000
We can't bring every job
back that's left our shore.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.266
But right now, it's getting
more expensive to do business in

00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:55.533
places like China.

00:10:55.533 --> 00:10:59.266
Meanwhile, America
is more productive.

00:10:59.266 --> 00:11:02.967
A few weeks ago, the CEO of
Master Lock told me that it now

00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:07.066
makes business sense for
him to bring jobs back home.

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:14.734
(applause)

00:11:14.734 --> 00:11:17.800
Today, for the first
time in 15 years,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.834
Master Lock's unionized plant
in Milwaukee is running at

00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:22.200
full capacity.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.934
(applause)

00:11:26.934 --> 00:11:32.567
So we have a huge
opportunity, at this moment,

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.300
to bring manufacturing back.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.767
But we have to seize it.

00:11:37.767 --> 00:11:41.200
Tonight, my message to
business leaders is simple:

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.800
Ask yourselves what you can
do to bring jobs back to your

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.300
country, and your country will
do everything we can to help

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.367
you succeed.

00:11:49.367 --> 00:11:58.233
(applause)

00:11:58.233 --> 00:12:01.266
We should start
with our tax code.

00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:04.834
Right now, companies get tax
breaks for moving jobs and

00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:07.800
profits overseas.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.934
Meanwhile, companies that choose
to stay in America get hit with

00:12:10.934 --> 00:12:14.133
one of the highest tax
rates in the world.

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:18.033
It makes no sense,
and everyone knows it.

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:20.734
So let's change it.

00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:24.834
First, if you're a business
that wants to outsource jobs,

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:27.567
you shouldn't get a tax
deduction for doing it.

00:12:27.567 --> 00:12:34.667
(applause)

00:12:34.667 --> 00:12:37.233
That money should be used
to cover moving expenses for

00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:41.233
companies like Master Lock
that decide to bring jobs home.

00:12:41.233 --> 00:12:45.233
(applause)

00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:50.000
Second, no American company
should be able to avoid paying

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.667
its fair share of taxes
by moving jobs and

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:53.900
profits overseas.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:59.367
(applause)

00:12:59.367 --> 00:13:02.767
From now on, every multinational
company should have to pay a

00:13:02.767 --> 00:13:04.400
basic minimum tax.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.033
And every penny should go
towards lowering taxes for

00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:11.867
companies that choose to stay
here and hire here in America.

00:13:11.867 --> 00:13:24.700
(applause)

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.200
Third, if you're an
American manufacturer,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.233
you should get a bigger tax cut.

00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:33.166
If you're a high-tech
manufacturer,

00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:36.066
we should double the tax
deduction you get for making

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.467
your products here.

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:40.934
And if you want to relocate in a
community that was hit hard when

00:13:40.934 --> 00:13:45.100
a factory left town, you should
get help financing a new plant,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.467
equipment, or training
for new workers.

00:13:48.467 --> 00:13:49.500
So my message --

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.333
(applause)

00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:53.000
My message is simple.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.200
It is time to stop rewarding
businesses that ship jobs

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.133
overseas, and start rewarding
companies that create jobs right

00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:01.333
here in America.

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:05.166
Send me these tax reforms, and
I will sign them right away.

00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:18.500
(applause)

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.600
We're also making it easier
for American businesses to sell

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.467
products all over the world.

00:14:24.467 --> 00:14:27.633
Two years ago, I set a goal
of doubling U.S. exports

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:29.834
over five years.

00:14:29.834 --> 00:14:33.000
With the bipartisan trade
agreements we signed into law,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.667
we're on track to meet that
goal ahead of schedule.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:41.533
(applause)

00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:44.033
And soon, there will be millions
of new customers for American

00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:48.633
goods in Panama,
Colombia, and South Korea.

00:14:48.633 --> 00:14:51.600
Soon, there will be new cars on
the streets of Seoul imported

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.400
from Detroit, and
Toledo, and Chicago.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.867
(applause)

00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:03.266
I will go anywhere in the
world to open new markets for

00:15:03.266 --> 00:15:05.900
American products.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.433
And I will not stand by when
our competitors don't play

00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:11.367
by the rules.

00:15:11.367 --> 00:15:15.166
We've brought trade cases
against China at nearly twice

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:17.500
the rate as the last
administration --

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.800
and it's made a difference.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.467
(applause)

00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:27.433
Over a thousand Americans are
working today because we stopped

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:28.800
a surge in Chinese tires.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.600
But we need to do more.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.367
It's not right when another
country lets our movies, music,

00:15:36.367 --> 00:15:37.600
and software be pirated.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.667
It's not fair when foreign
manufacturers have a leg up on

00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:46.233
ours only because they're
heavily subsidized.

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:49.166
Tonight, I'm announcing the
creation of a Trade Enforcement

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:52.567
Unit that will be charged with
investigating unfair trading

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:54.934
practices in
countries like China.

00:15:54.934 --> 00:15:56.533
There will be more
inspections --

00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:59.533
(applause)

00:15:59.533 --> 00:16:02.734
There will be more inspections
to prevent counterfeit or unsafe

00:16:02.734 --> 00:16:05.166
goods from crossing our borders.

00:16:05.166 --> 00:16:08.467
And this Congress should make
sure that no foreign company has

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:11.467
an advantage over American
manufacturing when it comes to

00:16:11.467 --> 00:16:14.633
accessing financing or
new markets like Russia.

00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:16.767
Our workers are the most
productive on Earth,

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:19.967
and if the playing field
is level, I promise you --

00:16:19.967 --> 00:16:21.633
America will always win.

00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:39.166
(applause)

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:42.133
I also hear from many business
leaders who want to hire in the

00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:46.967
United States but can't find
workers with the right skills.

00:16:46.967 --> 00:16:50.033
Growing industries in science
and technology have twice as

00:16:50.033 --> 00:16:54.767
many openings as we have
workers who can do the job.

00:16:54.767 --> 00:16:58.000
Think about that -- openings
at a time when millions of

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.200
Americans are looking for work.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.000
It's inexcusable.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.533
And we know how to fix it.

00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:11.000
Jackie Bray is a single mom from
North Carolina who was laid off

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.767
from her job as a mechanic.

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:17.133
Then Siemens opened a gas
turbine factory in Charlotte,

00:17:17.133 --> 00:17:19.500
and formed a partnership
with Central Piedmont

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.633
Community College.

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:24.667
The company helped the college
design courses in laser and

00:17:24.667 --> 00:17:26.800
robotics training.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.667
It paid Jackie's tuition,
then hired her to help

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:33.633
operate their plant.

00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:36.667
I want every American looking
for work to have the same

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:39.200
opportunity as Jackie did.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.700
Join me in a national commitment
to train 2 million Americans

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.033
with skills that will
lead directly to a job.

00:17:47.033 --> 00:18:02.000
(applause)

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.300
My administration has already
lined up more companies that

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.934
want to help.

00:18:05.934 --> 00:18:08.834
Model partnerships between
businesses like Siemens and

00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:11.800
community colleges in places
like Charlotte, and Orlando,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.100
and Louisville are
up and running.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.433
Now you need to give more
community colleges the resources

00:18:18.433 --> 00:18:21.734
they need to become
community career centers --

00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:25.500
places that teach people skills
that businesses are looking for

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.567
right now, from data management
to high-tech manufacturing.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:33.433
And I want to cut through the
maze of confusing training

00:18:33.433 --> 00:18:37.000
programs, so that from now on,
people like Jackie have one

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.133
program, one website, and
one place to go for all the

00:18:41.133 --> 00:18:42.800
information and
help that they need.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.700
It is time to turn our
unemployment system into a

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.200
reemployment system that
puts people to work.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:19:05.300
(applause)

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.767
These reforms will help people
get jobs that are open today.

00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:13.200
But to prepare for
the jobs of tomorrow,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.266
our commitment to skills and
education has to start earlier.

00:19:18.266 --> 00:19:21.367
For less than 1% of what our
nation spends on education each

00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:25.300
year, we've convinced nearly
every state in the country to

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.200
raise their standards for
teaching and learning --

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.233
the first time that's
happened in a generation.

00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:34.400
But challenges remain.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.533
And we know how to solve them.

00:19:37.533 --> 00:19:41.300
At a time when other countries
are doubling down on education,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.033
tight budgets have forced
states to lay off thousands

00:19:44.033 --> 00:19:46.667
of teachers.

00:19:46.667 --> 00:19:50.166
We know a good teacher can
increase the lifetime income of

00:19:50.166 --> 00:19:52.734
a classroom by over $250,000.

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:58.834
A great teacher can offer an
escape from poverty to the child

00:19:58.834 --> 00:20:02.233
who dreams beyond
his circumstance.

00:20:02.233 --> 00:20:05.800
Every person in this chamber can
point to a teacher who changed

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.700
the trajectory of their lives.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.734
Most teachers work
tirelessly, with modest pay,

00:20:12.734 --> 00:20:16.200
sometimes digging into their own
pocket for school supplies --

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.633
just to make a difference.

00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:21.867
Teachers matter.

00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:25.667
So instead of bashing them,
or defending the status quo,

00:20:25.667 --> 00:20:28.433
let's offer schools a deal.

00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:31.767
Give them the resources to
keep good teachers on the job,

00:20:31.767 --> 00:20:34.166
and reward the best ones.

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:39.433
And in return, grant
schools flexibility:

00:20:39.433 --> 00:20:41.934
to teach with
creativity and passion;

00:20:41.934 --> 00:20:46.100
to stop teaching to the test;
and to replace teachers who just

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.867
aren't helping kids learn.

00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:51.000
That's a bargain worth making.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:03.300
(applause)

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.367
We also know that when students
don't walk away from their

00:21:06.367 --> 00:21:12.500
education, more of them walk
the stage to get their diploma.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:20.700
When students are not allowed
to drop out, they do better.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:28.700
So tonight, I am proposing that
every state -- every state --

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.400
requires that all students
stay in high school until they

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.867
graduate or turn 18.

00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:48.000
(applause)

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.133
When kids do graduate, the most
daunting challenge can be the

00:21:51.133 --> 00:21:53.567
cost of college.

00:21:53.567 --> 00:21:56.533
At a time when Americans owe
more in tuition debt than credit

00:21:56.533 --> 00:22:00.600
card debt, this Congress needs
to stop the interest rates on

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.934
student loans from
doubling in July.

00:22:02.934 --> 00:22:15.767
(applause)

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:20.233
Extend the tuition tax credit we
started that saves millions of

00:22:20.233 --> 00:22:24.266
middle-class families
thousands of dollars,

00:22:24.266 --> 00:22:28.033
and give more young people the
chance to earn their way through

00:22:28.033 --> 00:22:31.433
college by doubling the number
of work-study jobs in the

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:32.834
next five years.

00:22:32.834 --> 00:22:37.633
(applause)

00:22:37.633 --> 00:22:41.934
Of course, it's not enough for
us to increase student aid.

00:22:41.934 --> 00:22:45.533
We can't just keep subsidizing
skyrocketing tuition;

00:22:45.533 --> 00:22:47.600
we'll run out of money.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.900
States also need
to do their part,

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.700
by making higher education
a higher priority in

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.567
their budgets.

00:22:54.567 --> 00:22:58.066
And colleges and universities
have to do their part by working

00:22:58.066 --> 00:23:00.767
to keep costs down.

00:23:00.767 --> 00:23:03.266
Recently, I spoke with a group
of college presidents who've

00:23:03.266 --> 00:23:05.767
done just that.

00:23:05.767 --> 00:23:08.867
Some schools redesign courses
to help students finish

00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:10.500
more quickly.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.000
Some use better technology.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.600
The point is, it's possible.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.667
So let me put colleges and
universities on notice:

00:23:18.667 --> 00:23:21.200
If you can't stop
tuition from going up,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.333
the funding you get from
taxpayers will go down.

00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:28.200
Higher education
can't be a luxury --

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.934
it is an economic imperative
that every family in America

00:23:31.934 --> 00:23:35.300
should be able to afford.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.166
Let's also remember that
hundreds of thousands of

00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:42.133
talented, hardworking students
in this country face another

00:23:42.133 --> 00:23:47.367
challenge: the fact that they
aren't yet American citizens.

00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:50.467
Many were brought here
as small children,

00:23:50.467 --> 00:23:53.266
are American
through and through,

00:23:53.266 --> 00:23:57.533
yet they live every day with
the threat of deportation.

00:23:57.533 --> 00:24:00.600
Others came more recently, to
study business and science and

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.967
engineering, but as soon
as they get their degree,

00:24:03.967 --> 00:24:07.467
we send them home to invent new
products and create new jobs

00:24:07.467 --> 00:24:10.000
somewhere else.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.500
That doesn't make sense.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.633
I believe as strongly as
ever that we should take on

00:24:15.633 --> 00:24:17.433
illegal immigration.

00:24:17.433 --> 00:24:21.033
That's why my administration
has put more boots on the border

00:24:21.033 --> 00:24:23.300
than ever before.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.300
That's why there are fewer
illegal crossings than when I

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.200
took office.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.633
The opponents of action
are out of excuses.

00:24:31.633 --> 00:24:34.033
We should be working on
comprehensive immigration

00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:35.500
reform right now.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:51.500
(cheering and applause)

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.266
But if election-year politics
keeps Congress from acting on a

00:24:55.266 --> 00:24:59.367
comprehensive plan, let's at
least agree to stop expelling

00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:02.934
responsible young people
who want to staff our labs,

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:06.600
start new businesses,
defend this country.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.667
Send me a law that gives
them the chance to earn

00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:10.700
their citizenship.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.467
I will sign it right away.

00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:27.500
(cheering and applause)

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.000
You see, an economy built to
last is one where we encourage

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.700
the talent and ingenuity of
every person in this country.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.000
That means women should earn
equal pay for equal work.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:55.800
(cheering and applause)

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.900
It means we should support
everyone who's willing to work,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.834
and every risk-taker and
entrepreneur who aspires to

00:26:02.834 --> 00:26:06.667
become the next Steve Jobs.

00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:11.600
After all, innovation is what
America has always been about.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.300
Most new jobs are created in
start-ups and small businesses.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:19.233
So let's pass an agenda
that helps them succeed.

00:26:19.233 --> 00:26:22.400
Tear down regulations that
prevent aspiring entrepreneurs

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.667
from getting the
financing to grow.

00:26:24.667 --> 00:26:28.333
Expand tax relief to small
businesses that are raising

00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:30.900
wages and creating good jobs.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.734
Both parties agree
on these ideas.

00:26:33.734 --> 00:26:37.400
So put them in a bill, and
get it on my desk this year.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:45.900
(applause)

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.934
Innovation also
demands basic research.

00:26:49.934 --> 00:26:52.867
Today, the discoveries taking
place in our federally financed

00:26:52.867 --> 00:26:56.800
labs and universities could
lead to new treatments that kill

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.700
cancer cells but leave
healthy ones untouched.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.934
New lightweight vests for cops
and soldiers that can stop

00:27:03.934 --> 00:27:06.266
any bullet.

00:27:06.266 --> 00:27:09.800
Don't gut these
investments in our budget.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:14.700
Don't let other countries
win the race for the future.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.500
Support the same kind of
research and innovation that led

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.800
to the computer chip
and the Internet;

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.867
to new American jobs and
new American industries.

00:27:22.867 --> 00:27:28.734
And nowhere is the promise
of innovation greater than in

00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:30.100
American-made energy.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:37.533
Over the last three years, we've
opened millions of new acres for

00:27:37.533 --> 00:27:40.266
oil and gas exploration,
and tonight,

00:27:40.266 --> 00:27:44.367
I'm directing my administration
to open more than 75% of our

00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:47.233
potential offshore
oil and gas resources.

00:27:47.233 --> 00:27:56.200
(applause)

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.800
Right now -- right now --
American oil production is the

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.033
highest that it's
been in eight years.

00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:07.600
That's right -- eight years.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.700
Not only that -- last year, we
relied less on foreign oil than

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.200
in any of the past 16 years.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:21.233
(applause)

00:28:21.233 --> 00:28:27.367
But with only 2% of the world's
oil reserves, oil isn't enough.

00:28:27.367 --> 00:28:31.166
This country needs an all-out,
all-of-the-above strategy that

00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:35.100
develops every available
source of American energy.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:48.800
(cheering and applause)

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:55.600
A strategy that's cleaner,
cheaper, and full of new jobs.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.266
We have a supply of natural gas
that can last America nearly

00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:01.266
100 years.

00:29:01.266 --> 00:29:04.433
(applause)

00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:07.900
And my administration will take
every possible action to safely

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.033
develop this energy.

00:29:10.033 --> 00:29:13.166
Experts believe this will
support more than 600,000 jobs

00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:14.934
by the end of the decade.

00:29:14.934 --> 00:29:17.734
And I'm requiring all companies
that drill for gas on public

00:29:17.734 --> 00:29:21.000
lands to disclose the
chemicals they use.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.734
Because America will develop
this resource without putting

00:29:24.734 --> 00:29:29.066
the health and safety
of our citizens at risk.

00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:31.767
The development of natural
gas will create jobs and power

00:29:31.767 --> 00:29:35.533
trucks and factories that
are cleaner and cheaper,

00:29:35.533 --> 00:29:38.567
proving that we don't have to
choose between our environment

00:29:38.567 --> 00:29:40.467
and our economy.

00:29:40.467 --> 00:29:46.000
And by the way, it was
public research dollars,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.700
over the course of 30 years,
that helped develop the

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.867
technologies to extract all this
natural gas out of shale rock --

00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:57.400
reminding us that government
support is critical in helping

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.834
businesses get new energy
ideas off the ground.

00:30:01.834 --> 00:30:02.834
Now --

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:06.000
(applause)

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.133
What's true for natural gas is
just as true for clean energy.

00:30:13.133 --> 00:30:15.734
In three years, our partnership
with the private sector has

00:30:15.734 --> 00:30:19.667
already positioned America to be
the world's leading manufacturer

00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:22.100
of high-tech batteries.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.767
Because of federal investments,
renewable energy use has nearly

00:30:25.767 --> 00:30:28.867
doubled, and thousands
of Americans have jobs

00:30:28.867 --> 00:30:31.400
because of it.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:36.333
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off
from his job making furniture,

00:30:36.333 --> 00:30:38.834
he said he worried that at
55, no one would give him a

00:30:38.834 --> 00:30:41.066
second chance.

00:30:41.066 --> 00:30:45.200
But he found work at Energetx,
a wind turbine manufacturer

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.133
in Michigan.

00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:52.200
Before the recession, the
factory only made luxury yachts.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.667
Today, it's hiring workers
like Bryan, who said,

00:30:54.667 --> 00:31:00.600
"I'm proud to be working in
the industry of the future."

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.767
Our experience with shale gas,
our experience with natural gas,

00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:08.834
shows us that the payoffs on
these public investments don't

00:31:08.834 --> 00:31:11.800
always come right away.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.667
Some technologies don't pan
out; some companies fail.

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:21.800
But I will not walk away from
the promise of clean energy.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.934
I will not walk away
from workers like Bryan.

00:31:24.934 --> 00:31:36.633
(applause)

00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:42.200
I will not cede the wind or
solar or battery industry to

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.233
China or Germany because
we refuse to make the same

00:31:46.233 --> 00:31:48.533
commitment here.

00:31:48.533 --> 00:31:51.600
We've subsidized oil
companies for a century.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.800
That's long enough.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.834
It's time to end the taxpayer
giveaways to an industry that

00:31:56.834 --> 00:32:00.166
rarely has been more profitable,
and double-down on a clean

00:32:00.166 --> 00:32:04.500
energy industry that never
has been more promising.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.800
Pass clean energy tax credits.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.967
Create these jobs.

00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:15.333
(applause)

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:20.033
We can also spur energy
innovation with new incentives.

00:32:20.033 --> 00:32:23.233
The differences in this chamber
may be too deep right now to

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:28.033
pass a comprehensive plan
to fight climate change.

00:32:28.033 --> 00:32:30.867
But there's no reason why
Congress shouldn't at least set

00:32:30.867 --> 00:32:36.633
a clean energy standard that
creates a market for innovation.

00:32:36.633 --> 00:32:39.700
So far, you haven't acted.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.533
Well, tonight, I will.

00:32:41.533 --> 00:32:45.867
I'm directing my administration
to allow the development of

00:32:45.867 --> 00:32:49.600
clean energy on enough public
land to power 3 million homes.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.700
And I'm proud to announce that
the Department of Defense,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:59.433
working with us, the world's
largest consumer of energy,

00:32:59.433 --> 00:33:02.166
will make one of the largest
commitments to clean energy in

00:33:02.166 --> 00:33:04.900
history -- with the Navy
purchasing enough capacity to

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.667
power a quarter of a
million homes a year.

00:33:07.667 --> 00:33:21.967
(applause)

00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:25.967
Of course, the easiest way
to save money is to waste

00:33:25.967 --> 00:33:27.734
less energy.

00:33:27.734 --> 00:33:31.500
So here's a proposal: Help
manufacturers eliminate energy

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.934
waste in their factories and
give businesses incentives to

00:33:34.934 --> 00:33:37.667
upgrade their buildings.

00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:41.166
Their energy bills will be $100
billion lower over the next

00:33:41.166 --> 00:33:44.400
decade, and America will
have less pollution,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.100
more manufacturing, more
jobs for construction workers

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.266
who need them.

00:33:49.266 --> 00:33:52.700
Send me a bill that
creates these jobs.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:34:00.967
(applause)

00:34:00.967 --> 00:34:04.600
Building this new energy future
should be just one part of a

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.633
broader agenda to repair
America's infrastructure.

00:34:08.633 --> 00:34:12.400
So much of America
needs to be rebuilt.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.567
We've got crumbling
roads and bridges;

00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:19.133
a power grid that
wastes too much energy;

00:34:19.133 --> 00:34:22.767
an incomplete high-speed
broadband network that prevents

00:34:22.767 --> 00:34:25.700
a small business owner in
rural America from selling her

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.700
products all over the world.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:34.066
During the Great Depression,
America built the Hoover Dam and

00:34:34.066 --> 00:34:36.467
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:40.100
After World War II, we connected
our states with a system

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.300
of highways.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.567
Democratic and Republican
administrations invested in

00:34:45.567 --> 00:34:48.533
great projects that
benefited everybody,

00:34:48.533 --> 00:34:51.800
from the workers who built them
to the businesses that still use

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.600
them today.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.000
In the next few weeks, I will
sign an executive order clearing

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.400
away the red tape that
slows down too many

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.667
construction projects.

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:05.734
But you need to
fund these projects.

00:35:05.734 --> 00:35:08.667
Take the money we're no
longer spending at war,

00:35:08.667 --> 00:35:10.467
use half of it to
pay down our debt,

00:35:10.467 --> 00:35:13.100
and use the rest to do
some nation-building right

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.033
here at home.

00:35:14.033 --> 00:35:30.867
(cheering and applause)

00:35:30.867 --> 00:35:34.133
There's never been a
better time to build,

00:35:34.133 --> 00:35:36.300
especially since the
construction industry was one of

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.867
the hardest hit when the
housing bubble burst.

00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:43.567
Of course, construction
workers weren't the only ones

00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:45.433
who were hurt.

00:35:45.433 --> 00:35:48.300
So were millions of innocent
Americans who've seen their home

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.567
values decline.

00:35:50.567 --> 00:35:54.800
And while government can't
fix the problem on its own,

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.066
responsible homeowners shouldn't
have to sit and wait for the

00:35:58.066 --> 00:36:02.433
housing market to hit
bottom to get some relief.

00:36:02.433 --> 00:36:06.166
And that's why I'm sending this
Congress a plan that gives every

00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:11.000
responsible homeowner the chance
to save about $3,000 a year on

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.700
their mortgage, by refinancing
at historically low rates.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.100
No more red tape.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.767
No more runaround
from the banks.

00:36:17.767 --> 00:36:19.700
(applause)

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.333
A small fee on the largest
financial institutions will

00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:25.900
ensure that it won't add to
the deficit and will give those

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.133
banks that were rescued by
taxpayers a chance to repay a

00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:30.367
deficit of trust.

00:36:30.367 --> 00:36:44.834
(cheering and applause)

00:36:44.834 --> 00:36:49.333
Let's never forget: Millions of
Americans who work hard and play

00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:53.133
by the rules every day deserve
a government and a financial

00:36:53.133 --> 00:36:55.633
system that do the same.

00:36:55.633 --> 00:36:58.734
It's time to apply the same
rules from top to bottom.

00:36:58.734 --> 00:37:02.166
No bailouts, no
handouts, and no copouts.

00:37:02.166 --> 00:37:05.700
An America built to last
insists on responsibility

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.767
from everybody.

00:37:08.767 --> 00:37:11.900
We've all paid the price for
lenders who sold mortgages to

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.533
people who couldn't afford
them, and buyers who knew they

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:18.000
couldn't afford them.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.800
That's why we need smart
regulations to prevent

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.033
irresponsible behavior.

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:30.500
(applause)

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:36.166
Rules to prevent financial
fraud or toxic dumping or faulty

00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:41.400
medical devices -- these
don't destroy the free market.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.533
They make the free
market work better.

00:37:45.533 --> 00:37:48.433
There's no question that some
regulations are outdated,

00:37:48.433 --> 00:37:52.100
unnecessary, or too costly.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.000
In fact, I've approved fewer
regulations in the first three

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.734
years of my presidency than
my Republican predecessor

00:37:57.734 --> 00:37:58.967
did in his.

00:37:58.967 --> 00:38:03.633
(applause)

00:38:03.633 --> 00:38:06.934
I've ordered every federal
agency to eliminate rules that

00:38:06.934 --> 00:38:08.834
don't make sense.

00:38:08.834 --> 00:38:12.300
We've already announced
over 500 reforms,

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.800
and just a fraction of them will
save business and citizens more

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.600
than $10 billion over
the next five years.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.300
We got rid of one rule from 40
years ago that could have forced

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.300
some dairy farmers to spend
$10,000 a year proving that they

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.266
could contain a spill -- because
milk was somehow classified

00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:33.066
as an oil.

00:38:33.066 --> 00:38:35.200
With a rule like that, I
guess it was worth crying

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.967
over spilled milk.

00:38:36.967 --> 00:38:42.467
(laughter and applause)

00:38:42.467 --> 00:38:49.934
Now, I'm confident a farmer can
contain a milk spill without a

00:38:49.934 --> 00:38:52.533
federal agency looking
over his shoulder.

00:38:52.533 --> 00:39:01.767
(applause)

00:39:01.767 --> 00:39:02.767
Absolutely.

00:39:02.767 --> 00:39:09.300
(applause)

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.567
But I will not back down from
making sure an oil company can

00:39:13.567 --> 00:39:17.233
contain the kind of oil spill we
saw in the Gulf two years ago.

00:39:17.233 --> 00:39:28.033
(cheering and applause)

00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:31.200
I will not back down from
protecting our kids from mercury

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.467
poisoning, or making sure
that our food is safe and our

00:39:35.467 --> 00:39:38.166
water is clean.

00:39:38.166 --> 00:39:41.667
I will not go back to the days
when health insurance companies

00:39:41.667 --> 00:39:45.834
had unchecked power to cancel
your policy, deny your coverage,

00:39:45.834 --> 00:39:47.900
or charge women
differently than men.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:59.333
(cheering and applause)

00:39:59.333 --> 00:40:01.867
And I will not go back to
the days when Wall Street was

00:40:01.867 --> 00:40:05.867
allowed to play by
its own set of rules.

00:40:05.867 --> 00:40:10.734
The new rules we passed restore
what should be any financial

00:40:10.734 --> 00:40:15.333
system's core purpose: Getting
funding to entrepreneurs with

00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:18.900
the best ideas, and getting
loans to responsible families

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.967
who want to buy a home,
or start a business,

00:40:21.967 --> 00:40:25.166
or send their kids to college.

00:40:25.166 --> 00:40:29.266
So if you are a big bank
or financial institution,

00:40:29.266 --> 00:40:31.633
you're no longer allowed to
make risky bets with your

00:40:31.633 --> 00:40:33.900
customers' deposits.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.667
You're required to write out
a "living will" that details

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:39.667
exactly how you'll pay
the bills if you fail --

00:40:39.667 --> 00:40:42.667
because the rest of us are not
bailing you out ever again.

00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:52.834
(applause)

00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:56.200
And if you're a mortgage lender
or a payday lender or a credit

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.233
card company, the days of
signing people up for products

00:40:59.233 --> 00:41:02.600
they can't afford with confusing
forms and deceptive practices --

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.800
those days are over.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.400
Today, American consumers
finally have a watchdog in

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.633
Richard Cordray with one
job: To look out for them.

00:41:11.633 --> 00:41:24.667
(cheering and applause)

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:27.967
We'll also establish a Financial
Crimes Unit of highly trained

00:41:27.967 --> 00:41:31.667
investigators to crack down on
large-scale fraud and protect

00:41:31.667 --> 00:41:33.867
people's investments.

00:41:33.867 --> 00:41:37.200
Some financial firms violate
major anti-fraud laws because

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.100
there's no real penalty for
being a repeat offender.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.834
That's bad for consumers, and
it's bad for the vast majority

00:41:44.834 --> 00:41:48.266
of bankers and financial
service professionals who do

00:41:48.266 --> 00:41:50.100
the right thing.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.734
So pass legislation that makes
the penalties for fraud count.

00:41:54.734 --> 00:41:57.367
And tonight, I'm asking my
Attorney General to create a

00:41:57.367 --> 00:42:00.467
special unit of federal
prosecutors and leading state

00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:04.567
attorney general to expand our
investigations into the abusive

00:42:04.567 --> 00:42:06.934
lending and packaging of risky
mortgages that led to the

00:42:06.934 --> 00:42:08.633
housing crisis.

00:42:08.633 --> 00:42:11.667
This new unit will hold
accountable those who broke the

00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:14.834
law, speed assistance
to homeowners,

00:42:14.834 --> 00:42:17.767
and help turn the page on an
era of recklessness that hurt so

00:42:17.767 --> 00:42:21.567
many Americans.

00:42:21.567 --> 00:42:26.867
Now, a return to the American
values of fair play and shared

00:42:26.867 --> 00:42:33.533
responsibility will help protect
our people and our economy.

00:42:33.533 --> 00:42:36.900
But it should also guide us as
we look to pay down our debt and

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.400
invest in our future.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.900
Right now, our most immediate
priority is stopping a tax hike

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.700
on 160 million working
Americans while the recovery is

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.633
still fragile.

00:42:48.633 --> 00:43:03.800
(applause)

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.600
People cannot afford losing $40
out of each paycheck this year.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.100
There are plenty of
ways to get this done.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.000
So let's agree right here,
right now: No side issues.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.667
No drama.

00:43:17.667 --> 00:43:21.367
Pass the payroll tax
cut without delay.

00:43:21.367 --> 00:43:22.300
Let's get it done.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:32.700
(applause)

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.734
When it comes to the deficit,
we've already agreed to more

00:43:35.734 --> 00:43:37.734
than $2 trillion in
cuts and savings.

00:43:37.734 --> 00:43:45.700
But we need to do more, and
that means making choices.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:50.633
Right now, we're poised to spend
nearly $1 trillion more on what

00:43:50.633 --> 00:43:54.266
was supposed to be a temporary
tax break for the wealthiest 2%

00:43:54.266 --> 00:43:56.700
of Americans.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:01.433
Right now, because of loopholes
and shelters in the tax code,

00:44:01.433 --> 00:44:05.233
a quarter of all millionaires
pay lower tax rates than

00:44:05.233 --> 00:44:09.333
millions of
middle-class households.

00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:12.300
Right now, Warren Buffett
pays a lower tax rate than

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.767
his secretary.

00:44:15.767 --> 00:44:17.500
Do we want to keep
these tax cuts for the

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.767
wealthiest Americans?

00:44:18.767 --> 00:44:24.233
Or do we want to keep our
investments in everything else

00:44:24.233 --> 00:44:27.700
-- like education
and medical research;

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:32.600
a strong military and
care for our veterans?

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.033
Because if we're serious
about paying down our debt,

00:44:35.033 --> 00:44:39.300
we can't do both.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.567
The American people know
what the right choice is.

00:44:43.567 --> 00:44:46.166
So do I.

00:44:46.166 --> 00:44:47.900
As I told the
Speaker this summer,

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.533
I'm prepared to make more
reforms that rein in the

00:44:50.533 --> 00:44:52.967
long-term costs of
Medicare and Medicaid,

00:44:52.967 --> 00:44:56.633
and strengthen Social Security,
so long as those programs remain

00:44:56.633 --> 00:44:59.967
a guarantee of
security for seniors.

00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:04.700
But in return, we need to change
our tax code so that people like

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.800
me, and an awful lot
of members of Congress,

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.667
pay our fair share of taxes.

00:45:09.667 --> 00:45:26.633
(applause)

00:45:26.633 --> 00:45:29.266
Tax reform should
follow the Buffett Rule.

00:45:29.266 --> 00:45:32.633
If you make more than
$1 million a year,

00:45:32.633 --> 00:45:34.834
you should not pay
less than 30% in taxes.

00:45:34.834 --> 00:45:38.667
And my Republican friend
Tom Coburn is right:

00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:42.700
Washington should stop
subsidizing millionaires.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.333
In fact, if you're earning
a million dollars a year,

00:45:45.333 --> 00:45:50.367
you shouldn't get special
tax subsidies or deductions.

00:45:50.367 --> 00:45:54.567
On the other hand, if you
make under $250,000 a year,

00:45:54.567 --> 00:46:01.033
like 98% of American families,
your taxes shouldn't go up.

00:46:01.033 --> 00:46:06.300
You're the ones struggling with
rising costs and stagnant wages.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.567
(applause)

00:46:08.567 --> 00:46:12.533
You're the ones who need relief.

00:46:12.533 --> 00:46:16.667
Now, you can call this
class warfare all you want.

00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:19.033
But asking a billionaire to
pay at least as much as his

00:46:19.033 --> 00:46:21.800
secretary in taxes?

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.266
Most Americans would
call that common sense.

00:46:26.266 --> 00:46:30.967
We don't begrudge financial
success in this country.

00:46:30.967 --> 00:46:33.767
We admire it.

00:46:33.767 --> 00:46:36.500
When Americans talk about folks
like me paying my fair share of

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:40.734
taxes, it's not because
they envy the rich.

00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:44.100
It's because they understand
that when I get a tax break I

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.633
don't need and the
country can't afford,

00:46:47.633 --> 00:46:52.600
it either adds to the deficit,
or somebody else has to make up

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:57.133
the difference -- like a
senior on a fixed income,

00:46:57.133 --> 00:46:59.500
or a student trying
to get through school,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.900
or a family trying
to make ends meet.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.834
That's not right.

00:47:04.834 --> 00:47:07.834
Americans know that's not right.

00:47:07.834 --> 00:47:11.800
They know that this generation's
success is only possible because

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.467
past generations felt a
responsibility to each other,

00:47:15.467 --> 00:47:17.633
and to the future
of their country,

00:47:17.633 --> 00:47:22.600
and they know our way of life
will only endure if we feel that

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.000
same sense of shared
responsibility.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.166
That's how we'll
reduce our deficit.

00:47:30.166 --> 00:47:32.700
That's an America built to last.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:42.133
(applause)

00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:45.533
Now, I recognize that people
watching tonight have differing

00:47:45.533 --> 00:47:52.400
views about taxes and debt,
energy and health care.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.367
But no matter what
party they belong to,

00:47:55.367 --> 00:47:58.100
I bet most Americans are
thinking the same thing right

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:04.066
about now: Nothing will get
done in Washington this year,

00:48:04.066 --> 00:48:08.700
or next year, or maybe
even the year after that,

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:12.967
because Washington is broken.

00:48:12.967 --> 00:48:18.233
Can you blame them for
feeling a little cynical?

00:48:18.233 --> 00:48:22.533
The greatest blow to our
confidence in our economy last

00:48:22.533 --> 00:48:26.266
year didn't come from
events beyond our control.

00:48:26.266 --> 00:48:29.200
It came from a debate in
Washington over whether the

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.934
United States would
pay its bills or not.

00:48:33.934 --> 00:48:38.667
Who benefited from that fiasco?

00:48:38.667 --> 00:48:41.200
I've talked tonight about the
deficit of trust between Main

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.667
Street and Wall Street.

00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:45.333
But the divide between this city
and the rest of the country is

00:48:45.333 --> 00:48:52.266
at least as bad -- and it
seems to get worse every year.

00:48:52.266 --> 00:48:54.767
Some of this has to do with the
corrosive influence of money

00:48:54.767 --> 00:48:57.100
in politics.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.800
So together, let's take
some steps to fix that.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.734
Send me a bill that bans insider
trading by members of Congress;

00:49:03.734 --> 00:49:04.934
I will sign it tomorrow.

00:49:04.934 --> 00:49:19.734
(cheering and applause)

00:49:19.734 --> 00:49:23.633
Let's limit any elected official
from owning stocks in industries

00:49:23.633 --> 00:49:25.800
they impact.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.066
Let's make sure people who
bundle campaign contributions

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:33.667
for Congress can't lobby
Congress, and vice versa --

00:49:33.667 --> 00:49:36.333
an idea that has
bipartisan support,

00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:40.867
at least outside of Washington.

00:49:40.867 --> 00:49:44.000
Some of what's broken has to do
with the way Congress does its

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.734
business these days.

00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:51.100
A simple majority is no longer
enough to get anything --

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.834
even routine business --
passed through the Senate.

00:49:53.834 --> 00:49:57.734
(applause)

00:49:57.734 --> 00:50:01.600
Neither party has been
blameless in these tactics.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.934
Now both parties should
put an end to it.

00:50:04.934 --> 00:50:12.233
(applause)

00:50:12.233 --> 00:50:17.000
For starters, I ask the Senate
to pass a simple rule that all

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.200
judicial and public service
nominations receive a simple up

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.567
or down vote within 90 days.

00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:36.433
(applause)

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:39.767
The executive branch
also needs to change.

00:50:39.767 --> 00:50:43.433
Too often, it's inefficient,
outdated and remote.

00:50:43.433 --> 00:50:47.367
(applause)

00:50:47.367 --> 00:50:49.433
That's why I've asked this
Congress to grant me the

00:50:49.433 --> 00:50:51.667
authority to consolidate
the federal bureaucracy,

00:50:51.667 --> 00:50:54.266
so that our government
is leaner, quicker,

00:50:54.266 --> 00:50:57.400
and more responsive to the
needs of the American people.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:05.066
(applause)

00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:10.033
Finally, none of this can
happen unless we also lower the

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.900
temperature in this town.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.500
We need to end the notion that
the two parties must be locked

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:20.600
in a perpetual campaign
of mutual destruction;

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.667
that politics is about clinging
to rigid ideologies instead of

00:51:24.667 --> 00:51:29.033
building consensus around
common-sense ideas.

00:51:29.033 --> 00:51:30.967
I'm a Democrat.

00:51:30.967 --> 00:51:34.734
But I believe what Republican
Abraham Lincoln believed:

00:51:34.734 --> 00:51:37.900
That government should do for
people only what they cannot do

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.233
better by themselves,
and no more.

00:51:40.233 --> 00:52:01.000
(applause)

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.667
That's why my education reform
offers more competition,

00:52:03.667 --> 00:52:07.433
and more control for
schools and states.

00:52:07.433 --> 00:52:10.633
That's why we're getting rid
of regulations that don't work.

00:52:10.633 --> 00:52:13.900
That's why our health care law
relies on a reformed private

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:17.667
market, not a
government program.

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:20.266
On the other hand, even my
Republican friends who complain

00:52:20.266 --> 00:52:22.967
the most about government
spending have supported

00:52:22.967 --> 00:52:26.133
federally financed roads,
and clean energy projects,

00:52:26.133 --> 00:52:31.266
and federal offices for
the folks back home.

00:52:31.266 --> 00:52:34.433
The point is, we should
all want a smarter,

00:52:34.433 --> 00:52:35.967
more effective government.

00:52:35.967 --> 00:52:40.800
And while we may not be able to
bridge our biggest philosophical

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.934
differences this year, we
can make real progress.

00:52:45.934 --> 00:52:50.066
With or without this Congress,
I will keep taking actions that

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:52.667
help the economy grow.

00:52:52.667 --> 00:52:56.633
But I can do a whole
lot more with your help.

00:52:56.633 --> 00:52:59.734
Because when we act together,
there's nothing the United

00:52:59.734 --> 00:53:01.767
States of America can't achieve.

00:53:01.767 --> 00:53:19.567
(applause)

00:53:19.567 --> 00:53:22.266
That's the lesson we've learned
from our actions abroad over the

00:53:22.266 --> 00:53:25.133
last few years.

00:53:25.133 --> 00:53:28.433
Ending the Iraq war has allowed
us to strike decisive blows

00:53:28.433 --> 00:53:30.867
against our enemies.

00:53:30.867 --> 00:53:35.166
From Pakistan to Yemen, the al
Qaeda operatives who remain are

00:53:35.166 --> 00:53:38.800
scrambling, knowing that they
can't escape the reach of the

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.400
United States of America.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:47.033
(applause)

00:53:47.033 --> 00:53:50.800
From this position of strength,
we've begun to wind down the war

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.000
in Afghanistan.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.567
Ten thousand of our
troops have come home.

00:53:56.567 --> 00:54:00.767
Twenty-three thousand more will
leave by the end of this summer.

00:54:00.767 --> 00:54:02.900
This transition to Afghan
lead will continue,

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:06.467
and we will build an enduring
partnership with Afghanistan,

00:54:06.467 --> 00:54:09.433
so that it is never
again a source of attacks

00:54:09.433 --> 00:54:10.500
against America.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:17.133
(applause)

00:54:17.133 --> 00:54:21.033
As the tide of war recedes, a
wave of change has washed across

00:54:21.033 --> 00:54:25.367
the Middle East and North
Africa, from Tunis to Cairo;

00:54:25.367 --> 00:54:28.734
from Sana'a to Tripoli.

00:54:28.734 --> 00:54:32.133
A year ago, Qaddafi was one
of the world's longest-serving

00:54:32.133 --> 00:54:37.533
dictators -- a murderer with
American blood on his hands.

00:54:37.533 --> 00:54:38.900
Today, he is gone.

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:43.400
And in Syria, I have no doubt
that the Assad regime will soon

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.867
discover that the forces of
change cannot be reversed,

00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:49.667
and that human dignity
cannot be denied.

00:54:49.667 --> 00:55:05.934
(applause)

00:55:05.934 --> 00:55:09.166
How this incredible
transformation will end

00:55:09.166 --> 00:55:10.166
remains uncertain.

00:55:10.166 --> 00:55:13.333
But we have a huge
stake in the outcome.

00:55:13.333 --> 00:55:17.700
And while it's ultimately up
to the people of the region to

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:22.166
decide their fate, we will
advocate for those values that

00:55:22.166 --> 00:55:25.467
have served our own
country so well.

00:55:25.467 --> 00:55:28.800
We will stand against
violence and intimidation.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.734
We will stand for the rights and
dignity of all human beings --

00:55:32.734 --> 00:55:36.800
men and women; Christians,
Muslims and Jews.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.200
We will support policies that
lead to strong and stable

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.633
democracies and open markets,
because tyranny is no match

00:55:43.633 --> 00:55:46.000
for liberty.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.667
And we will safeguard America's
own security against those who

00:55:48.667 --> 00:55:53.734
threaten our citizens, our
friends, and our interests.

00:55:53.734 --> 00:55:54.734
Look at Iran.

00:55:54.734 --> 00:55:57.266
Through the power
of our diplomacy,

00:55:57.266 --> 00:56:00.934
a world that was once divided
about how to deal with Iran's

00:56:00.934 --> 00:56:04.800
nuclear program
now stands as one.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.967
The regime is more
isolated than ever before;

00:56:08.967 --> 00:56:11.133
its leaders are faced
with crippling sanctions,

00:56:11.133 --> 00:56:14.967
and as long as they shirk
their responsibilities,

00:56:14.967 --> 00:56:18.333
this pressure will not relent.

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:22.967
Let there be no doubt: America
is determined to prevent Iran

00:56:22.967 --> 00:56:25.800
from getting a nuclear weapon,
and I will take no options off

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.667
the table to achieve that goal.

00:56:27.667 --> 00:56:42.867
(applause)

00:56:42.867 --> 00:56:46.700
But a peaceful resolution of
this issue is still possible,

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:51.367
and far better, and if Iran
changes course and meets its

00:56:51.367 --> 00:56:56.800
obligations, it can rejoin
the community of nations.

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.700
The renewal of American
leadership can be felt

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.166
across the globe.

00:57:01.166 --> 00:57:07.166
Our oldest alliances in Europe
and Asia are stronger than ever.

00:57:07.166 --> 00:57:10.600
Our ties to the
Americas are deeper.

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.500
Our ironclad commitment
-- and I mean ironclad --

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.333
to Israel's security has meant
the closest military cooperation

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.900
between our two
countries in history.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:33.233
(applause)

00:57:33.233 --> 00:57:35.700
We've made it clear that
America is a Pacific power,

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:41.500
and a new beginning in
Burma has lit a new hope.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.934
From the coalitions we've built
to secure nuclear materials,

00:57:44.934 --> 00:57:48.533
to the missions we've led
against hunger and disease;

00:57:48.533 --> 00:57:51.133
from the blows we've
dealt to our enemies,

00:57:51.133 --> 00:57:57.233
to the enduring power of our
moral example, America is back.

00:57:57.233 --> 00:58:01.133
Anyone who tells you otherwise,
anyone who tells you that

00:58:01.133 --> 00:58:04.867
America is in decline or
that our influence has waned,

00:58:04.867 --> 00:58:06.800
doesn't know what
they're talking about.

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:22.266
(cheering and applause)

00:58:22.266 --> 00:58:24.600
That's not the message we get
from leaders around the world

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.333
who are eager to work with us.

00:58:27.333 --> 00:58:30.600
That's not how people
feel from Tokyo to Berlin,

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:34.400
from Cape Town to Rio, where
opinions of America are higher

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.633
than they've been in years.

00:58:37.633 --> 00:58:40.066
Yes, the world is changing.

00:58:40.066 --> 00:58:43.433
No, we can't
control every event.

00:58:43.433 --> 00:58:47.200
But America remains the one
indispensable nation in world

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.467
affairs -- and as long as I'm
President, I intend to keep

00:58:50.467 --> 00:58:51.333
it that way.

00:58:51.333 --> 00:59:03.433
(applause)

00:59:03.433 --> 00:59:06.600
That's why, working with
our military leaders,

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.700
I've proposed a new defense
strategy that ensures we

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.834
maintain the finest
military in the world,

00:59:12.834 --> 00:59:17.066
while saving nearly half a
trillion dollars in our budget.

00:59:17.066 --> 00:59:19.834
To stay one step ahead
of our adversaries,

00:59:19.834 --> 00:59:22.367
I've already sent this Congress
legislation that will secure our

00:59:22.367 --> 00:59:25.166
country from the growing
dangers of cyber-threats.

00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:30.266
(applause)

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:34.934
Above all, our freedom endures
because of the men and women in

00:59:34.934 --> 00:59:37.100
uniform who defend it.

00:59:37.100 --> 01:00:14.066
(applause)

01:00:14.066 --> 01:00:17.000
As they come home, we
must serve them as well as

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.333
they've served us.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:22.266
That includes giving them the
care and the benefits they have

01:00:22.266 --> 01:00:26.333
earned -- which is why we've
increased annual VA spending

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:28.300
every year I've been President.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:34.700
(applause)

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.533
And it means enlisting our
veterans in the work of

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:40.467
rebuilding our nation.

01:00:40.467 --> 01:00:42.934
With the bipartisan
support of this Congress,

01:00:42.934 --> 01:00:47.367
we're providing new tax credits
to companies that hire vets.

01:00:47.367 --> 01:00:49.967
Michelle and Jill Biden have
worked with American businesses

01:00:49.967 --> 01:00:54.133
to secure a pledge of
135,000 jobs for veterans and

01:00:54.133 --> 01:00:55.967
their families.

01:00:55.967 --> 01:00:59.467
And tonight, I'm proposing a
Veterans Jobs Corps that will

01:00:59.467 --> 01:01:02.467
help our communities
hire veterans as cops and

01:01:02.467 --> 01:01:05.834
firefighters, so that America
is as strong as those who

01:01:05.834 --> 01:01:06.767
defend her.

01:01:06.767 --> 01:01:22.667
(applause)

01:01:22.667 --> 01:01:28.266
Which brings me back
to where I began.

01:01:28.266 --> 01:01:33.300
Those of us who've been sent
here to serve can learn a thing

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:38.266
or two from the
service of our troops.

01:01:38.266 --> 01:01:41.967
When you put on that uniform, it
doesn't matter if you're black

01:01:41.967 --> 01:01:48.500
or white; Asian, Latino, Native
American; conservative, liberal;

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:54.166
rich, poor; gay, straight.

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:56.633
When you're marching
into battle,

01:01:56.633 --> 01:02:03.367
you look out for the person next
to you, or the mission fails.

01:02:03.367 --> 01:02:06.266
When you're in the
thick of the fight,

01:02:06.266 --> 01:02:12.200
you rise or fall as one
unit, serving one nation,

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.800
leaving no one behind.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.266
One of my proudest possessions
is the flag that the SEAL Team

01:02:21.266 --> 01:02:25.867
took with them on the
mission to get bin Laden.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.700
On it are each of their names.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.200
Some may be Democrats.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.100
Some may be Republicans.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.734
But that doesn't matter.

01:02:37.734 --> 01:02:40.100
Just like it didn't matter
that day in the Situation Room,

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:45.333
when I sat next to Bob Gates
-- a man who was George Bush's

01:02:45.333 --> 01:02:48.800
defense secretary --
and Hillary Clinton --

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.166
a woman who ran against
me for president.

01:02:53.166 --> 01:02:56.033
All that mattered that
day was the mission.

01:02:56.033 --> 01:03:01.567
No one thought about politics.

01:03:01.567 --> 01:03:05.700
No one thought about themselves.

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.433
One of the young men involved in
the raid later told me that he

01:03:08.433 --> 01:03:11.367
didn't deserve credit
for the mission.

01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:14.700
It only succeeded, he said,
because every single member of

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.967
that unit did their job -- the
pilot who landed the helicopter

01:03:19.967 --> 01:03:24.266
that spun out of control; the
translator who kept others from

01:03:24.266 --> 01:03:28.967
entering the compound; the
troops who separated the women

01:03:28.967 --> 01:03:36.667
and children from the fight; the
SEALs who charged up the stairs.

01:03:36.667 --> 01:03:40.333
More than that, the mission only
succeeded because every member

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:43.867
of that unit trusted
each other --

01:03:43.867 --> 01:03:46.200
because you can't
charge up those stairs,

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.934
into darkness and danger, unless
you know that there's somebody

01:03:51.934 --> 01:03:58.133
behind you, watching your back.

01:03:58.133 --> 01:04:01.166
So it is with America.

01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:05.066
Each time I look at that flag,
I'm reminded that our destiny is

01:04:05.066 --> 01:04:10.633
stitched together like those
50 stars and those 13 stripes.

01:04:10.633 --> 01:04:13.967
No one built this
country on their own.

01:04:13.967 --> 01:04:17.967
This nation is great because
we built it together.

01:04:17.967 --> 01:04:22.767
This nation is great
because we worked as a team.

01:04:22.767 --> 01:04:25.934
This nation is great because
we get each other's backs.

01:04:25.934 --> 01:04:30.900
And if we hold fast to that
truth, in this moment of trial,

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.400
there is no challenge too
great; no mission too hard.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.533
As long as we are joined
in common purpose,

01:04:38.533 --> 01:04:41.800
as long as we maintain
our common resolve,

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.834
our journey moves forward,
and our future is hopeful,

01:04:44.834 --> 01:04:48.800
and the state of our Union
will always be strong.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.233
Thank you, God bless you, and
God bless the United States

01:04:51.233 --> 01:04:52.166
of America.

01:04:52.166 --> 01:05:06.667
(cheering and applause)
