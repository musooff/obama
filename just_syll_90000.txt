Thanks

The
Pres
i
dent:
For
years
the
gov
ern
ment
has
spent
more
money
than
it
takes
in.
The
re
sult
is
a
lot
of
debt
on
our
na
tion's
credit
card
--
debt
that
un
less
we
act
will
weaken
our
econ
omy
cause
higher
in
ter
est
rates
for
fam
i
lies
and
force
us
to
scale
back
things
like
ed
u
ca
tion
and
Medi
care
folks
in
Wash
ing
ton
like
to
blame
one
an
other
for
this
prob
lem
But
the
truth
is,
nei
ther
party
is
blame
less
And
both
par
ties
have
a
re
spon
si
bil
ity
to
do
some
thing
about
it.
Every
fam
i
lies
are
fig
ur
ing
out
how
stretch
their
pay
checks
--
strug
gling
to
cut
what
they
can't
af
ford
so
they
can
pay
for
what's
re
ally
im
por
tant
It's
time
for
Wash
ing
ton
to
do
the
same
thing
But
for
that
to
hap
pen
it
means
that
Democrats
and
Repub
li
cans
have
to
work
to
gether
It
means
we
need
to
put
aside
our
dif
fer
ences
to
do
what's
right
for
the
coun
try
Every
one
is
go
ing
to
have
to
be
will
ing
to
com
pro

Other
wise
we
'll
never
get
any
thing
done
That's
why
we
need
a
bal
anced
ap
proach
to
cut
ting
the
deficit
We
need
an
ap
proach
that
goes
af
ter
waste
in
the
bud
get
and
gets
rid
of
pet
projects
that
cost
bil
lions
of

We
need
an
ap
proach
that
makes
some
se
ri
ous
cuts
to
wor
thy

--
cuts
I
wouldn't
make
un
der
nor
mal
cir
cum

And
we
need
an
ap
proach
that
asks
ev
ery
body
to
do
their
part
So
that
means
we
have
to
make
se
ri
ous
bud
get
cuts;
but
that
it's
not
right
to
ask
mid
dle
class
fam
i
lies
to
pay
more
for
col
lege
be
fore
we
ask
the
big
gest
cor
po

to
pay
their
fair

of

It
means
that
be
fore
we
stop

we
should
ask
oil
com
pa

and
cor

Be

Be

That's
the
heart
of
this

And
it's

in

So
there
will
be
plenty
of

gling
over
the

in

But
this

boils
down
to
a
sim

We
can
come
to

for
the
good
of
the

reach

we

Or

Well

And

The
Pres
i
dent:
This
week
the
United
States
and
our
in
ter
na
tional
in
ter
na
tional
part
ners
fi
nally
achieved
some
thing
that
decades
of
an
i
mos
ity
has
not
-
a
deal
that
will
pre
vent
Iran
from
ob
tain
ing
a
nu
clear
weapon
This
deal
will
make
Amer
ica
and
the
world
safer
and
more
se
cure
Still
you
're
go
ing
to
hear
a
lot
of
over
heated
and
of
ten
dis
hon
est
ar
gu
ments
about
it
in
the
weeks
ahead
So
to
day
I
want
to
take
a
mo
ment
to
take
those
on
one
by
and
ex
plain
what
this
deal
does
and
what
it
means
First
you
'll
hear
some
crit
ics
ar
gue
that
this
deal
some
how
makes
it
eas
ier
for
Iran
to
ob
tain
a
nu
clear
weapon
if
you
think
it
sounds
strange
that
the
United
States
Great
Bri
tain
France
Ger
many
Rus
sia
China
and
some
of
the
world's
best
nu
clear
sci
en
tists
would
agree
to
some
thing
like
that
you
're
right
This
deal
ac
tu
ally
closes
off
Iran's
path
way
to
a
nu
clear
weapon
To
day
Iran
has
enough
nu
clear
ma
te
rial
to
pro
duce
up
to
10
nu
clear
weapons
With
this
deal
they
'll
have
to
ship
98%
of
that
ma
te
rial
out
of
the
coun
try
-
leav
ing
them
with
a
frac
tion
of
what
it
takes
to
make
even
one
weapon
With
this
deal
they
'll
have
to
re
pur
pose
two
key
nu
clear
fa
cil
i
ties
so
they
can't
pro
duce
ma
te
ri
als
that
could
be
used
for
a
nu
clear
weapon
So
this
deal
ac
tu
ally
pushes
Iran
fur
ther
away
from
a
bomb
And
there's
a
per
ma
nent
pro
hi
bi
tion
on
Iran
ever
hav
ing
a
nu
clear
weapon
Se
cond
you
might
hear
from
crit
ics
that
Iran
could
just
ig
nore
what's
re
quired
and
do
what
ever
they
want
That
they
're
in
evitably
go
ing
to
cheat
Well
that's
wrong
With
this
deal
we
will
have
un
prece
dented
24/7
mon
i
tor
ing
of
Iran's
key
nu
clear
fa
cil
i
ties
With
this
deal
in
ter
na
tional
in
spec
tors
will
have
ac
cess
to
Iran's
en
tire
nu
clear
sup
ply
chain
The
ver
i
fi
ca
tion
process
set
up
by
this
deal
is
com
pre
hen
sive
and
it
is
in
tru
sive
-
pre
cisely
so
we
can
make
sure
Iran
keeps
its
com
mit
ments
Third
you
might
hear
from
crit
ics
that
Iran
faces
no
con
se
quences
if
it
vi
o
lates
this
deal
That's
also
patently
false
If
Iran
vi
o
lates
this
deal
the
sanc
tions
we
im
posed
that
have
helped
crip
ple
the
Ira
nian
econ
omy
-
the
sanc
tions
that
helped
make
this
deal
pos
si
ble
-
would
snap
back
into
place
promptly
There's
a
rea
son
this
deal
took
so
long
to
ne
go
ti
ate
Be
cause
we
re
fused
to
ac
cept
a
bad
deal
We
held
out
for
a
deal
that
met
ev
ery
one
of
our
bot
tom
lines
And
we
got
it.
Does
this
deal
re
solve
all
of
the
threats
Iran
poses
to
its
neigh
bors
and
the
world?
No.
Does
it
do
more
than
any
one
has
done
be
fore
to
make
sure
Iran
does
not
ob
tain
a
nu
clear
weapon?
And
that
was
our
top
pri
or
ity
from
the
start
That's
why
it's
in
ev
ery
one's
best
in
ter
est
to
make
sure
this
deal
holds
Be
cause
with
out
this
deal
there
would
be
no
lim
its
on
Iran's
nu
clear
pro

There
would
be
no

ing
no

The
sanc
tions
we
ral
lied
the
world
to
im
pose
would
un
ravel
Iran
could
move
closer
to
a
nu
clear
weapon
Other
coun
tries
in
the
re
gion
might
race
to
do
the
same
And
we'd
risk
an
other
war
in
the
most
volatile
re
gion
in
the
world
That's
what
would
hap
pen
with
out
this
deal
On

of
war
and
peace
we
should
have
tough
hon

We
've
seen

That's
why
this

The
Pres

To
day
we
pause
to
re
mem
ber
a
day
that
tested
our
coun
try
On
Septem
ber
11,
2001
nearly
3,000
lives
were
lost
in
the
dead
li
est
at
tack
on
Amer
i
can
soil
in
our
his

We
will
never
for
get
the
im
ages
of
planes
van
ish
ing
into
build
ings;
of
pho
tos
hung
by
the
fam
i
lies
of
the
miss
ing
We
will
never
for
get
the
anger
and
the
sad
ness
that
we
felt
And
while
nine
years
have
come
and
gone
since
that
Septem
ber
morn
ing
the
pas
sage
of
time
will
never
di
min
ish
the
pain
and
loss
for
ever
seared
in
the
con
scious
ness
of
our
na

That's
on
this
we
pray
with
the
fam
i
lies
of
those
who
died
We
mourn
with
the
hus
bands
and
wives
the
chil
dren
and
par
ents
friends
and
loved
ones
We
think
about
the
mile
stones
that
have
passed
over
the
course
of
nine
years
--
births
and
chris
ten
ings
wed
dings
and
grad
u
a
tions
--
all
with
an
empty
chair
On
this
we
also
honor
those
who
died
so
that
oth
ers
might
live:
the
fire
fight
ers
and
first
re
spon
ders
who
climbed
the
stairs
of
two
burn
ing
tow
ers;
the
pas
sen
gers
who
stormed
a
cock
pit;
and
the
men
and
women
who
have
in
the
years
since
borne
the
uni
form
of
this
coun
try
and
given
their
lives
so
that
our
chil
dren
could
grow
up
in
a
safer
world
In
acts
of
courage
and
de
cency
they
de
fended
a
sim
ple
pre
cept:
I
am
my
brother's
keep
er;
I
am
my
sis
ter's
keeper
And
on
this
we
re
call
that
at
our
dark
est
mo
ment
we
sum
moned
a
sense
of
unity
and
com

pur

We
re
sponded
to
the
worst
kind
of
de
prav
ity
with
the
best
of
our
hu
man
ity
So,
each
year
at
this
time
we
re
new
our
re
solve
against
those
who
per
pe
trated
this
bar
baric
act
of
ter
ror
and
who
con
tinue
to
plot
against
us
--
for
we
will
never
wa
ver
in
de
fense
of
this
na

We
re
new
our
com
mit
ment
to
our
troops
and
all
who
serve
to
pro
tect
this
coun
try
and
to
their
fam
i
lies
But
we
also
re
new
the
true
spirit
of
that
Not
the
hu
man
ca
pac
ity
for
evil
but
the
hu
man
ca
pac
ity
for
good
Not
the
de
sire
to
de
stroy
but
the
im
pulse
to
save
That's
why
we
mark
Septem
ber
11th
as
a
Na
tional
Day
of
Ser
vice
and
Re
mem
brance
For
if
there
is
a
les
son
to
be
drawn
on
this
an
niver
sary
it
is
this:
we
are
one
na
tion
--
one
peo
ple
--
bound
not
only
by
grief
but
by
a
set
of
com
mon
ideals
And
that
by
giv
ing
back
to
our
com
mu
ni
ties
by
serv
ing
peo
ple
in
need
we
reaf
firm
our
ideals
--
in
de
fi
ance
of
those
who
would
do
us
grave
harm
We
prove
that
the
sense
of
re
spon
si
bil
ity
that
we
felt
for
one
an
other
that
day
nine
years
ago
was
not
a
fleet
ing
pas
sion
--
but
a
last
ing
virtue
This
is
a
dif
fi
cult
time
for
our
coun
try
And
it's
of
ten
in
such
mo
ments
that
some
try
to
stoke
bit
ter
ness
--
to
di
vide
us
based
on
our
dif
fer
ences
to
blind
us
to
what
we
have
in
com
mon
But
on
this
we
are
re
minded
that
at
our
best
we
do
not
give
in
to
this
temp
ta
tion
We
stand
with
one
an
other
We
fight
along
side
one
an
other
We
do
not
al
low
our
selves
to
be
de
fined
by
fear
but
rather
by
the
hopes
we
have
for
our
fam
i
lies
for
our
na
tion
and
for
a
brighter
fu

So
let
us
grieve
for
those
we
've
lost
honor
those
who
have
sac

and
do
our
best
to
live

al
Qaeda's
lead
er

And
one
year
our
troops
launched
the
op
er
a

that
killed
Osama
bin

The
goal
that
I
set
--
to
de
feat
al
Qaeda
and
deny
it
a
chance
to
re
build
--
is
within
reach
Be
cause
of
the
progress
we
've
made
I
was
able
to
sign
a
his
toric
agree
ment
be
tween
the
United
States
and
Afghanistan
that
de
fines
a
new
kind
of
re
la

ship
be
tween
our
coun

--
a
fu
ture
in
which
Afghans
are
re
spon
si
ble
for
the
se
cu

of
their
na
tion
and
we
build
an
equal
part
ner
ship
be
tween
two
sov
er
eign
states;
a
fu
ture
in
which
the
war
ends
and
a
new
chap
ter
be
gins
The
enor
mous
sac
ri
fices
of
our
men
and
women
in
uni
form
are
not
over
But
many
of
our
troops
are
al
ready
com
ing
home
Last
year
we
re
moved
10,000
troops
from
Afghanistan
Another
23,000
will
leave
by
the
end
of
the
sum
mer
As
our
coali
tion
agreed
by
the
end
of
2014
the
Afghans
will
be
fully
re
spon
si
ble
for
the
se
cu

of
their
coun

And
this
is
as
it
should
be.
Be
cause
af
ter
more
than
a
decade
of
it's
time
to
fo
cus
on

build
ing
here
at

As
a
new
great
est
gen
er
a
tion
re
turns
from
over
seas
we
must
ask
our
selves
what
kind
of
coun
try
will
they
come
back
to?
Will
it
be
a
coun
try
where
a
shrink
ing
num
ber
of
Amer
i
cans
do
re
ally
well
while
a
grow
ing
num
ber
barely
get
by?
Or
will
it
be
a
coun
try
where
ev
ery
one
gets
a
fair
shot
ev
ery
one
does
their
fair
share
and
ev
ery
one
plays
by
the
same
set
of
rules
--
a
coun

with
op
por
tu
nity
wor
thy
of

who
pro

My

of
Pat

got
the
chance
to
go
to

on
the
GI

My
grand
mother
who
worked
on
a
bomber
as

was
part
of
a
work
force
that
turned
out
the

on

They
con
trib

to
a
story
of
suc

that
ev

Amer
i
can
had
the
chance
to

in,
the
ba
sic
Amer

can
prom

that
if

you
could
do

enough
to

send

for

Keep

that

alive
is
the
defin

is
sue
of
our

But
it
means
mak
ing
re

choices
I
don't
think
we
should
pri
or
i
tize
things
like
more
tax
cuts
for
mil
lion

while
cut
ting
the
kinds
of
in

that
build
a
strong
mid
dle
class
That's
why
I've
called
on
Congress
to
take
the
money
we
're
no
longer
spend
ing
at
use
half
of
it
to
pay
down
our
debt
and
use
the
other
half
to
re
build
Amer

Be

we

We

We

And
we

so
that
we

as
well
as
they
have
served
us.
Every
time
I
have
the

I'm
struck
by
their

their

They

Hi,

Next

for

on
Main

Soon
af

that
I
took

And
we
set
out
to
re

our

on
a

for

and

by

To

our

13

over

The

We

Still
in

that's

based
on

in

some

is
the

to

By

That's
one

why
a

from

will
earn
you
$10,000
more
each

than
some

only

One
study
showed
that
a

from
a

you
$1

The

Will

The
Pres

This
week
I
spent
some
time
in
Racine
Wis
con
sin
talk
ing
with
folks
who
are
do
ing
their
best
to
cope
with
the
af
ter
math
of
a
bru
tal
re
ces
sion
And
while
I
was
there
a
young
woman
asked
me
a
ques
tion
I
hear
all
the
time:
"What
are
we
do
ing
as
a
na
tion
to
bring
jobs
back
to
this
coun
try?"
Well
on
Fri
day
we
learned
that
af
ter
22
straight
months
of
job
loss
our
econ
omy
has
now
cre
ated
jobs
in
the
pri
vate
sec
tor
for
six
months
in
a
That's
a
pos
i
tive
sign
But
the
truth
is,
the
re
ces
sion
from
which
we
're
emerg
ing
has
left
us
in
a
hole
that's
about
8
mil
lion
jobs
deep
And
as
I've
said
from
the
day
I
took
of
fice
it's
go
ing
to
take
months
even
years
to
dig
our
way
out
--
and
it's
go
ing
to
re
quire
an
all
-
hands
-
on

deck
ef

In
the
short

we
're
fight
ing
to
speed
up
this
re
cov

and
keep
the

That
means
ex
tend
ing
un
em
ploy
ment
in

for

lost
their
That
means
get
ting
small
busi
nesses
the
loans
they
need
to
keep
their
doors
open
and
hire
new
work
ers
And
that
means
send
ing
re
lief
to
states
so
they
don't
have
to
lay
off
thou
sands
of
teach
ers
and
fire
fight

and
po
lice
of

Still
at
a

when

of

feel
a
deep

of

And
on

I'm

The

Hi,
ev

body
For
the
first
time
in
more
than
6
years
the
un
em

ment
rate
is
be
low
6%.
Over
the
past
four
and
a
half
years
our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
more
than
10
mil
lion
new
jobs
That's
the
long
est
un
in
ter
rupted
stretch
of
pri
vate
sec
tor
job
cre
ation
in
our
his

But
while
our
busi

are
cre
at
ing
jobs
at
the
fastest
pace
since
the
'90s
the
typ
i
cal
fam
ily
hasn't
seen
a
raise
since
the
'90s
also
Folks
are
feel
ing
as
squeezed
as
ever
That's
why
I'm
go
ing
to
keep
push
ing
poli
cies
that
will
cre
ate
more
jobs
faster
and
raise
wages
faster
-
poli
cies
like
re
build
ing
our
in
fra
struc

mak
ing
sure
women
are
paid
fairly
and
mak
ing
it
eas
ier
for
young
peo
ple
to
pay
off
their
stu
dent
loans
But
one
of
the
sim
plest
and
fastest
ways
to
start
help
ing
folks
get
ahead
is
by
rais
ing
the
min
i
mum
wage
Ask
your
self:
could
you
live
on
$14,500
a
year?
That's
what
some
one
work
ing
full
-
time
on
the
min
i
mum
wage
makes
If
they
're
rais
ing
kids
that's
be
low
the
poverty
line
And
that's
not
right
A
hard
day's
work
de
serves
a
fair
day's
Right
a
worker
on
the
fed
eral
min
i
mum
wage
earns
$7.25
an
hour
It's
time
to
raise
that
to
$10.10
an
hour
Rais
ing
the
fed

min
i
mum
wage
to
ten
dol

or

Amer

28

And
these
aren't
just
high
school
ers
on
their
first
The
av
er
age
worker
who
would
ben
e
fit
is
35
years
Most
low
-
wage
work
ers
are
women
And
that
ex
tra
money
would
help
them
pay
the
bills
and
pro
vide
for
their
fam

It
also
means
they
'll
have
more
money
to
spend
at
lo
cal
busi

-
which
grows
the
econ
omy
for
ev

But
Congress
hasn't
voted
to
raise
the
min

in

Seven

And
when
it

That's

I

13

The
Pres

Hello
ev
ery
body
On
Thurs
day
I
went
down
to
Florida
to
visit
Dis
ney
world
And
to
Sasha
and
Malia's
great
dis
ap
point
ment
I
was
not
there
to
hang
out
with
Mickey
or
ride
the
Space
Moun
tain
In
stead
I
was
there
to
talk
about
steps
we
're
tak
ing
to
boost
tourism
and
cre
ate
jobs
Tourism
is
the
num
ber
one
ser
vice
we
ex
port
Every
year
tens
of
mil
lions
of
tourists
come
from
all
over
the
world
to
visit
Amer
ica
They
stay
in
our
ho
tels
eat
at
our
restau
rants
and
see
all
the
sights
Amer
ica
has
to
of
fer
That's
good
for
lo
cal
busi
nesses
That's
good
for
lo
cal
economies
And
the
more
folks
who
visit
Amer
ica
the
more
Amer
i
cans
we
get
back
to
work
It's
that
sim
ple
We
can't
wait
to
seize
this
op
por
tu
nity
As
I've
said
be
fore
I
will
con
tinue
to
work
with
Congress
states
and
lead
ers
in
the
pri
vate
sec
tor
to
find
ways
to
move
this
coun
try
for
ward
But
where
they
can't
act
or
won't
I
will
Be
cause
we
want
the
world
to
know
that
Amer
ica
is
open
for
busi
ness
And
that's
why
I
an
nounced
steps
we
're
tak
ing
to
pro
mote
Amer
ica
and
make
it
eas
ier
for
tourists
to
come
and
visit
Fre
quent
trav
el
ers
who
pass
an
ex
ten
sive
back
ground
check
will
be
able
to
scan
their

ports
and
fin
ger
prints
and
skip
the
long

at

at
more

ports
We
're
go

to
ex

the
num

of

tries
where
vis
i
tors
can
get
pre
-
cleared
by
Home
land
Se
cu

so
they
don't
need
a

visa
And
we
're
go

to

up

for

with

mid

that

coun
tries
like
China
and
Brazil
We
want
more

com

We
want
them

money

It's
good
for
our
econ

and
it
will
help
pro
vide
the
boost
more
busi

need
to
grow
and
to

And
we
can't
wait
to
make
it
hap
pen
Too
of
ten
over
the
last
few
months
we
've
seen
Congress
drag
its
feet
and
refuse
to
take
steps
we
know
will
help
strengthen
our
econ
omy
That's
why
this
is
the
lat

in

of

I've
taken

The
Pres
i
dent:
This
week
I
laid
out
my
plan
for
our
fis
cal
fu
ture
It's
a
bal
anced
plan
that
re
duces
spend
ing
and
brings
down
the
deficit
putting
Amer
ica
back
on
track
to
ward
pay
ing
down
our
debt
We
know
why
this
chal
lenge
is
so
crit
i
cal
If
we
don't
a
ris
ing
tide
of
bor
row
ing
will
dam
age
our
econ
omy
cost
ing
us
jobs
and
risk
ing
our
fu
ture
pros
per
ity
by
stick
ing
our
chil
dren
with
the
bill
At
the
same
time
we
have
to
take
a
bal
anced
ap
proach
to
re
duc
ing
our
deficit
--
an
ap
proach
that
pro
tects
the
mid
dle
class
our
com
mit
ments
to
se
niors
and
job
-
cre
at
ing
in
vest
ments
in
things
like
ed
u
ca
tion
and
clean
en
ergy
What's
re
quired
is
an
ap
proach
that
draws
sup
port
from
both
par
ties
and
one
that's
based
on
the
val
ues
of
shared
re
spon
si
bil
ity
and
shared
pros

one
plan
put
for

by
some
Repub

in

House
of
Rep
re
sen
ta
tives
aims
to
re
duce
our
deficit
by
$4
tril
lion
over
the
next
10
years
But
while
I
think
their
goal
is
wor
thy
I
be
lieve
their
vi
sion
is
wrong
for
Amer
ica
It's
a
vi
sion
that
says
at
a
time
when
other
na
tions
are
hus
tling
to
out
-
com
pete
us
for
the
jobs
and
busi

of
to

we
have
to
make
dras
tic
cuts
in
ed
u
ca

in
fra
struc

and
clean
en

--
the
very
in
vest
ments
we
need
to
win
that
com
pe
ti
tion
and
get
those
good
jobs
It's
a
vi
sion
that
says
that
in
or
der
to
re
duce
the
deficit
we
have
to
end
Medi
care
as
we
know
it,
and
make
cuts
to
Med
i
caid
that
would
leave
mil
lions
of
se
niors
poor
chil
dren
and
Amer
i
cans
with
dis
abil
i
ties
with
out
the
care
they
need
But
even
as
this
plan
pro
poses
these
dras
tic
cuts
it
would
also
give
$1
tril
lion
in
tax
breaks
to
the
wealth
i
est
2%
of
Amer
i
cans
--
an
ex
tra
$200,000
for
ev
ery
mil
lion
aire
and
bil
lion
aire
in
the
coun
try
I
don't
think
that's
right
I
don't
think
it's
right
to
ask
se
niors
to
pay
thou
sands
more
for
health
care
or
ask
stu
dents
to
post
pone
col
lege
just
so
we
don't
have
to
ask
those
who
have
pros
pered
so
much
in
this
land
of
op
por
tu
nity
to
give
back
a
lit
tle
more
To
re
store
fis
cal
re

si
bil

we
all
need
to
share
in
the
sac
ri
fice
--
but
we
don't
have
to
sac
ri
fice
the
Amer
ica
we
be
lieve
in.
That's
why
I've
pro
posed
a
bal
anced
ap
proach
that
matches
that
$4
tril
lion
in
deficit
re
duc

It's
an
ap
proach
that
combs
the
en
tire
bud

for

and
asks
ev
ery
one
to
do
their

And
I've
called
on
Democrats

to

me
in
this
ef

to
put

their

That's

it's
how
we
'll

We

Be

I
de

that

This
is
not

I

De

I
also

our
coun

will
be
stronger
if
we
act
to
gether
and
our
ac

will
be
more
ef
fec

That's
why
I
asked
Mem

of
Congress
to
de
bate
this
is
sue
and
vote
on
au
tho
riz
ing
the
use
of

What
we
're
talk
ing
about
is
not
an

-
ended
in

This
would
not
be
an
other
Iraq
or
Afghanistan
There
would
be
no
Amer

can

on

Any
ac

we
take
would
be
lim

both
in

-
de
signed
to
de

the
Syr

gov
ern

from
gassing
its
own
peo

again
and
de
grade
its
abil

to
do
so.
I
know
that
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
are
weary
af
ter
a
decade
of
even
as
the
war
in
Iraq
has
ended
and
the
war
in
Afghanistan
is
wind
ing
down
That's
why
we
're
not
putting
our
troops
in
the
mid

of
some
body
else's
But
we
are
the
United

of
Amer
ica
We
can
not
turn
a
blind
eye
to
im
ages
like
the
ones
we
've
seen
out
of
Syria
Fail
ing
to
re
spond
to
this
out
ra
geous
at
tack
would
in
crease
the
risk
that
chem
i
cal
weapons
could
be
used
again;
that
they
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
ter
ror
ists
who
might
use
them
against
us,
and
it
would
send
a
hor
ri
ble
sig
nal
to
other
na

that
there
would
be
no
con
se
quences
for
their
use
of
these
weapons
All
of
which
would
pose
a
se
ri

That's
why
we
can't

nore

at

like
this

-
even
if
they
hap
pen
half

And
that's
why
I
call
on
Mem

of
Congress
from
both
par

to
come
to

and
stand
up
for
the

This

We

Too
many

are

than

just
to

let

get

And
that's
been
true
since
long
be

That's
why
we
've

Ron

there's

That's

Most

And
rais

the

wouldn't
just

-
its

It

We

for

we

Most

reaf

I

That

the

So

And
I

my

would
have

had

been
a

That's
why
I
try
pretty
hard
to
be
a
good

for
my

I
haven't
al

suc

of

--
and
in
the

my

kept
me
away
from

more

liked
and
the

be

I've
learned
a
cou

of

about
what
our

need
most
from
their

First
and

most
they
need

And
more
im

than
the
quan

of

we
spend
with

is
the
qual

of
those

Maybe
it's
just
ask

about
their
or
talk
ing
a

to

but
the

can
have

whether

And

of

More

Others

And
even
for
those
dads
who
are
present
in
their
chil

lives
the
re
ces
sion
has
taken
a
harsh
toll
If

That's

as

On

I'd

Sasha
rolled

And
I
was

In

Hi

Fourth

what
our

is
all
about
-
what
hap
pened
237
years
and
what
it
meant
to
the
world
On
July
1776
a
small
band
of
pa
tri
ots
de
clared
that
we
were
a
peo
ple
cre

equal
-
free
to

and
wor

and
live
as
we
please
It
was
a
dec
la
ra

heard
around
the
world
-
that
we
were
no
longer
colonists
we
were
Amer
i
cans
and
our
des
tiny
would
not
be
de
ter
mined
for
us;
it
would
be
de
ter
mined
by
us.
It
was
a
bold
and
tremen
dously
brave
thing
to
do.
It
was
also
nearly

At
that

that

And
to
achieve
it
-
to
win
their
free

-
they
were
will
ing
to
lay
it
all
on
the
line
Their
lives
Their

Their

They

But
for
the
