The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the TABLE doing SHOTS
DRINKING FAST and then we talk SLOW
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a CHANCE now
Take my hand stop put van the Man on the JUKEBOX
And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like

GIRL you know I want your love
Your love was HANDMADE for somebody like me
Come on now follow my LEAD
I may be crazy don't mind me
Say boy let's not talk too much
GRAB on my WAIST and put that body on me
Come on now follow my LEAD
Come come on now follow my LEAD

I'm in love with the shape of you
We PUSH and PULL like a MAGNET do
although my heart is FALLING too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedSHEETS smell like you
Every day DISCOVERING something BRAND new
I'm in love with your body
I'm in love with your body
I'm in love with your body
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something BRAND new
I'm in love with the shape of you
