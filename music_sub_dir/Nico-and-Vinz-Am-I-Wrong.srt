0
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,455
Am I wrong

1
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,058
For thinking out the box from
where I stay?

2
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:40,351
Am I wrong

3
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:45,850
For saying that I choose another way?

4
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:49,953
I ain't trying to do what
everybody else doin'

5
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:54,356
Just 'cause everybody doin'
what they all do

6
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,263
If one thing I know,

7
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:58,150
I'll fall but I'll grow

8
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:01,861
I'm walking down this road of
mine, this road that I call
home

9
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:04,468
So am I wrong?

10
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:09,855
For thinking that we could be
something for real?

11
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,466
Now am I wrong?

12
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:17,653
For trying to reach the things
that I can't see?

13
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:21,458
But that's just how I feel,

14
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:25,751
That's just how I feel

15
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:28,350
That's just how I feel

16
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:34,153
Trying to reach the things
that I can't see

17
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:37,352
Am I tripping

18
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:41,851
For having a vision?

19
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:44,452
My prediction

20
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:50,453
I'ma be on the top of the world

21
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,666
Walk your walk and don't look back,

22
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,765
Always do what you decide

23
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,466
Don't let them control your life,

24
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:58,755
that's just how I feel oh whoa

25
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,664
Fight for yours and don't let go,

26
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:02,651
Don't let them compare you, no

27
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:06,154
Don't worry, you're not alone,
that's just how we feel

28
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:08,251
Am I wrong? (am I wrong?)

29
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:10,956

00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:13,861
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh)

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,759
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
