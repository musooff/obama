00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:17,901
The snow glows white on the
mountain tonight

1
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:21,610
Not a footprint to be seen

2
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:24,907
A kingdom of isolation

3
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:29,306
And it looks like I'm the queen

4
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:36,417
The wind is howling like this
swirling storm inside

5
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:43,404
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven
knows I tried

6
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,709
Don't let them in, don't let them see

7
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:50,100
Be the good girl you always have to be

8
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:56,617
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

9
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,906
Well, now they know

10
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:03,307
Let it go, let it go

11
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:06,804
Can't hold it back anymore

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,299
Let it go, let it go

13
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:14,502
Turn away and slam the door

14
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:20,517
I don't care what they're going to say

15
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:25,004
Let the storm rage on

16
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:32,411
The cold never bothered me anyway

17
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:38,504
It's funny how some distance
makes everything seem small

18
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:46,307
And the fears that once
controlled me can't get to me
at all

19
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,998
It's time to see what I can do

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,599
To test the limits and break through

21
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:57,704
No right, no wrong, no rules for me

22
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:01,213
I’m free

23
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:04,600
Let it go, let it go

24
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,109
I’m one with the wind and sky

25
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:11,704
Let it go, let it go

26
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:15,703
You’ll never see me cry

27
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:22,314
Here I stand and here I’ll stay

28
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:30,513
Let the storm rage on

29
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:40,912
My power flurries through the
air into the ground

30
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:47,911
My soul is spiraling in frozen
fractals all around

31
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:55,002
And one thought crystallizes
like an icy blast

32
00:02:55,208 --> 00:03:02,707
I’m never going back, the past
is in the past

33
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,216
Let it go, let it go

34
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:09,501
And I’ll rise like the break of dawn

35
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,108
Let it go, let it go

36
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:17,013
That perfect girl is gone

37
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:25,216
Here I stand in the light of day

38
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:31,011
Let the storm rage on

39
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:36,218
The cold never bothered me anyway

40
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:46,203
