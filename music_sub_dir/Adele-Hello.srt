00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:26,365
Hello, it's me

1
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:32,558
I was wondering if after all
these years you'd like to meet

2
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,959
To go over everything

3
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:41,752
They say that time's supposed to heal ya

4
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,755
But I ain't done much healing

5
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:50,564
Hello, can you hear me?

6
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:56,457
I'm in California dreaming
about who we used to be

7
00:01:56,653 --> 00:02:02,652
When we were younger and free

8
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:08,567
I've forgotten how it felt
before the world fell at our
feet

9
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:14,756
There's such a difference between us

10
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:21,765
And a million miles

11
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:27,552
Hello from the other side

12
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:33,057
I must have called a thousand times

13
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:38,750
To tell you I'm sorry for
everything that I've done

14
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:46,265
But when I call you never seem
to be home

15
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:51,664
Hello from the outside

16
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:57,051
At least I can say that I've tried

17
00:02:57,255 --> 00:03:03,054
To tell you I'm sorry for
breaking your heart

18
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:11,261
But it don't matter. It
clearly doesn't tear you apart
anymore

19
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:21,764
Hello, how are you?

20
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:27,955
It's so typical of me to talk
about myself. I'm sorry

21
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:33,650
I hope that you're well

22
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:39,667
Did you ever make it out of
that town where nothing ever
happened?

23
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:45,960
And it's no secret that the both of us

24
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:52,453
Are running out of time

25
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:58,668
So hello from the other side (
other side)

26
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,049
I must have called a thousand
times (thousand times)

27
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:09,762
To tell you I'm sorry for
everything that I've done

28
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:17,367
But when I call you never seem
to be home

29
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:23,064

To tell you I'm sorry for

32
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:41,759
But it don't matter. It
clearly doesn't tear you apart
anymore

I must have called a thousand
times (thousand times)
