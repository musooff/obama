0
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:21,111
What would I do without your
smart mouth?

1
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:24,716
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out

2
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:32,509
You've got my head spinning,
no kidding, I can't pin you
down

3
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:36,214
What's going on in that beautiful mind

4
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:40,007
I'm on your magical mystery ride

5
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:48,210
And I'm so dizzy, don't know
what hit me, but I'll be
alright

6
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:52,015
My head's under water

7
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:56,200
But I'm breathing fine

8
00:00:56,418 --> 00:01:02,017
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

9
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:05,106
'Cause all of me

10
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:08,911
Loves all of you

11
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,710
Love your curves and all your edges

12
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,405
All your perfect imperfections

13
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:20,002
Give your all to me

14
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:23,705
I'll give my all to you

15
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:27,712
You're my end and my beginning

16
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:31,405
Even when I lose I'm winning

17
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:39,008
'Cause I give you all of me

18
00:01:39,206 --> 00:01:47,205
And you give me all of you, oh oh

19
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:52,402
How many times do I have to tell you

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,099
Even when you're crying you're
beautiful too

21
00:01:56,309 --> 00:02:03,708
The world is beating you down,
I'm around through every mood

22
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,415
You're my downfall, you're my muse

23
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:11,314
My worst distraction, my
rhythm and blues

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:19,499
I can't stop singing, it's
ringing, in my head for you

25
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:23,516
My head's under water

26
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:27,701
But I'm breathing fine

27
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:33,508
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

28
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:36,417
'Cause all of me

29
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:40,508
Loves all of you

30
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:43,605
Love your curves and all your edges

31
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:47,700
All your perfect imperfections

32
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:51,205
Give your all to me

33
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:55,008
I'll give my all to you

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,999
You're my end and my beginning

35
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,908
Even when I lose I'm winning

36
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:10,205
'Cause I give you all of me

37
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:17,904
And you give me all of you, oh oh

38
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,309
Give me all of you

39
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:28,906
Cards on the table, we're both
showing hearts

40
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:34,301
Risking it all, though it's hard

41
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,214
'Cause all of me

42
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,815
Loves all of you

43
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:44,910
Love your curves and all your edges

44
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,599
All your perfect imperfections

You're my end and my beginning

Even when I lose I'm winning

49
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:11,412
'Cause I give you all of me

50
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:19,301
And you give me all of you

51
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:26,604
I give you all of me

52
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:31,817
And you give me all of you, oh oh
