00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:29,703
Well, you only need the light
when it's burning low,

1
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,804
Only miss the sun when it
starts to snow,

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,099
Only know you love her when
you let her go

3
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:42,714
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low

4
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,705
Only hate the road when you're
missing home

5
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:52,018
Only know you love her when
you let her go...

6
00:00:52,218 --> 00:01:00,217
And you let her go.

7
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,214
Staring at the bottom of your glass

8
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,901
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

9
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:18,108
But dreams come slow, and they
go so fast

10
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:20,807
You see her when you close your eyes

11
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:23,616
Maybe one day you'll understand why

12
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:30,007
Everything you touch surely dies

13
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:32,998
But you only need the light
when it's burning low

14
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:36,205
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

15
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:42,608
Only know you love her when
you let her go

16
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,601
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low

17
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:49,100
Only hate the road when you're
missing home

18
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:56,513
Only know you love her when
you let her go

19
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,800
Staring at the ceiling in the dark

20
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:01,903
Same old empty feeling in your heart

21
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:09,014
'Cause love comes slow, and it
goes so fast

22
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:11,405
Well you see her when you fall asleep

23
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:14,308
But never to touch and never to keep

24
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:21,011
Cause you loved her too much,
and you dived too deep

25
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:23,902
Well you only need the light
when it's burning low

26
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:27,305
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

27
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:33,710
Only know you love her when
you let her go

28
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:36,917
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low

29
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:40,208
Only hate the road when you're
missing home

30
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:46,701
Only know you love her when
you let her go

31
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:53,104
And you let her go ooooh ooooh oh no

32
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,605
And you let her go

33
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:59,110
ooooh ooooh oh no

34
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:07,311
Well you let her go

35

Cause you only need the light

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

37
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:25,202
Only know you love her when
you let her go

38
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,313
Only know you've been high
when you're feeling low

39
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,608
Only hate the road when you're
missing home

40
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:38,113
