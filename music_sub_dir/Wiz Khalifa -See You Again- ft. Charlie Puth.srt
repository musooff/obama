2
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:17,178
It's been a long day without you my friend

3
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:23,262
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

4
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:29,307
We've come a long way from where we began

5
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:35,086
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

6
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:38,142
When I see you again

7
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,209
Damn, who knew

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,050
All the planes we flew

9
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,734
Good things we been through

10
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:47,366
That I'd be standing right here talking to you

11
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:49,034
Bout another path

12
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:51,090
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

13
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,206
But something told me that it wouldn't last

14
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:57,197
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture

15
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:58,516
Those were the days

16
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,543
Hard work forever pays

17
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:02,234
Now I see you in a better place

18
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:08,387
Uh. How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?

19
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:11,332
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side

20
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:20,020
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you my friend

21
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:26,168
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

22
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:32,309
We've come a long way from where we began

23
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:38,084
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

24
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:40,994
When I see you again

25
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:47,382
Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oooh...

26
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:54,438
Oooh...Oooh... Oooh... Oooh... Oooh..

27
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,870
<font color=Aqua>Wiz Khalifa</font> First, you both go out your way

28
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:59,654
And the vibe is feeling strong

29
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:01,391
And what's small turned to a friendship

30
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:02,382
A friendship turned to a bond

31
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,235
And that bond will never be broken

32
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:07,180
The love will never get lost

33
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,054
And when brotherhood come first

34
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,468
Then the line will never be crossed

35
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:13,157
Established it on our own

36
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:14,222
When that line had to be drawn

37
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:16,042
And that line is what we reached

38
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:18,842
So remember me when i'm gone

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,247
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?

40
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:26,366
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side

41
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:29,038
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
