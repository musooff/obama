0
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:37,503
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make
the stars look like they're
not shining

1
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:42,200
Her hair, her hair falls
perfectly without her trying

2
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:44,501
She's so beautiful

3
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,718
And I tell her everyday.

4
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:55,101
Yeah, I know, I know when I
compliment her, she won't
believe me

5
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:59,506
And it's so, it's so sad to
think that she doesn't see
what I see

6
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:03,105
But every time she ask me do I
look okay?

7
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,700
I say

8
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:11,401
When I see your face

9
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:15,706
There's not a thing that I would change

10
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:18,911
'Cause you're amazing

11
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:24,616
Just the way you are

12
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:28,901
And when you smile

13
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:33,304
The whole world stops and
stares for a while

14
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:36,505
'Cause girl, you're amazing

15
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:43,602
Just the way you are

16
00:01:43,818 --> 00:01:48,017
Her lips, her lips, I could
kiss them all day if she'd let
me

17
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:52,514
Her laugh her laugh, she hates
but I think it's so sexy

18
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:55,105
She's so beautiful

19
00:01:55,313 --> 00:02:00,312
And I tell her everyday

20
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:05,117
Oh, you know, you know, you
know I'd never ask you to
change

21
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:09,710
If perfect's what you're
searching for, then just stay
the same

22
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,899
So don't even bother asking if
you look okay

23
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:17,104
You know I'll say

24
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:21,701
When I see your face

25
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,218
There's not a thing that I would change

26
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:29,405
'Cause girl you're amazing

27
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:35,114
Just the way you are

28
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:39,207
And when you smile

29
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:43,616
The whole world stops and
stares for a while

30
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:47,005
'Cause girl, you're amazing

31
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,198
Just the way you are

32
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,409
The way you are

33
00:02:56,619 --> 00:03:01,018
The way you are

34
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,709
Girl, you're amazing

35
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:10,208
Just the way you are

36
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:14,811
When I see your face

37
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,218
There's not a thing that I would change

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,399
'Cause girl you're amazing

39
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:27,510
Just the way you are

40
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,209
And when you smile

41
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:36,700
The whole world stops and
stares for a while

42
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:40,105
'Cause girl, you're amazing

43
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:45,402
Just the way you are.

44
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:50,613
Yeah
