0
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,899
Feeling my way through the
darkness

1
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:15,610
Guided by a beating heart

2
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:20,017
I can't tell where the journey
will end

3
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,518
But I know where it starts﻿

4
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:27,403
They tell me I'm too young to
understand

5
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:31,202
They say I'm caught up in a
dream

6
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:35,517
Well life will pass me by if I
don't open up my eyes

7
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,800
Well that's fine by me

8
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:41,715
So wake me up when it's all over

9
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:45,802
When I'm wiser and I'm older

10
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,111
All this time I was finding
myself

11
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:53,300
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,309
So wake me up when it's all over

13
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,498
When I'm wiser and I'm older

14
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,407
All this time I was finding
myself

15
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:12,602
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

16
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,107
They don't like us

17
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,900
Yeah i know

18
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:25,103
Why?

19
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,110
I tried carrying the weight of
the world

20
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:08,117
But I only have two hands

21
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:12,014
I hope I get the chance to
travel the world

22
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,709
And I don't have any plans

23
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:19,606
I wish that I could stay forever
this young

24
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:23,415
Not afraid to close my eyes

25
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:27,816
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone

26
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,103
And love is a prize

27
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,316
So wake me up when it's all
over

28
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:38,103
When I'm wiser and I'm older

29
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,610
All this time I was finding
myself

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,599
And I didn't know I was lost

31
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:49,408
So wake me up when it's all over

32
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:53,513
When I'm wiser and I'm older

33
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,714
All this time I was finding
myself

34
00:02:56,912 --> 00:03:02,211
And I didn't know I was lost

35
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:06,000
I didn't know I was lost

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,899
I didn't know I was lost

37
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,906
I didn't know I was lost

38
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:20,915
I didn't know I was lost

39
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,814
Get up, pack your things

40
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:25,613
Where we going?

41
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,804
Somewhere we belong
