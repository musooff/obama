Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep

1
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:08,754
Dreaming about the things that we could be

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:13,357
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,

6
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:39,651
I see this life like a swinging vine

7
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,660
Swing my heart across the line

8
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:43,761
And my face is flashing signs

9
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,762
Seek it out and you shall find

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,559
Old, but I'm not that old

11
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,560
Young, but I'm not that bold

12
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:51,651
I don't think the world is sold

13
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:53,756
I'm just doing what we're told

14
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:58,361
I feel something so right

15
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:01,850
Doing the wrong thing

16
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:06,251
I feel something so wrong

I could lie, coudn't I, could lie

19
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:17,162
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep

I feel the love and I feel it burn

31
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,368
Down this river, every turn

32
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,249
Hope is a four-letter word

33
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:04,264
Make that money, watch it burn

34
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,251
Old, but I'm not that old

35

I could lie, could lie, could lie

41
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:28,248
Everything that drowns me
makes me wanna fly
