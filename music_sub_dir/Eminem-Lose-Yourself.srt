1
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:35,416
Look

2
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,213
If you had

3
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,312
One shot

4
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:43,017
Or one opportunity

5
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:45,902
To seize everything you ever wanted

6
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:47,801
In one moment

7
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,502
Would you capture it

8
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:52,265
Or just let it slip?

9
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:53,014
Yo

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,409
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

11
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,214
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,999
He's nervous, but on the
surface he looks calm and ready

13
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,708
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'

14
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:07,717
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud

15
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,416
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

16
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,203
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now

17
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:16,114
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!

18
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:19,103
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity

19
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,106
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked

20
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:23,601
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No

21
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,500
He won't have it, he knows
his whole back city's ropes

22
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:29,313
It don't matter, he's dope,
he knows that, but he's broke

23
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,308
He's so stacked that he knows, when he
goes back to his mobile home, that's when its

24
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:35,905
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody

25
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:38,802
He better go capture this
moment and hope it don't pass him

26
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:41,117
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

27
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:43,816
You own it, you better never let it go

28
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:46,713
You only get one shot, do
not miss your chance to blow

29
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:50,202
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

30
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,499
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

31
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:55,208
You own it, you better never let it go

32
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:58,007
You only get one shot, do
not miss your chance to blow

33
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:01,100
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

34
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:04,115
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping

35
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,104
This world is mine for the taking

36
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:09,513
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order

37
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,608
A normal life is borin', but
super stardom's close to post mortem

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,399
It only grows harder, only grows hotter

39
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:19,204
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him

40
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:22,101
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter

41
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:26,312
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's
grown farther from home, he's no father

42
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,115
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

43
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:31,800
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water

44
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,699
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product

45
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:38,916
They moved on to the next schmo
who flows, he nose dove and sold nada

46
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:44,211
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I
suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on

47
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:45,506
Da da dumb da dumb da da

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,299
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

49
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:51,010
You own it, you better never let it go

50
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:54,011
You only get one shot, do
not miss your chance to blow

51
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:57,312
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

52
00:02:57,402 --> 00:02:59,501
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

53
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,308
You own it, you better never let it go

54
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:05,217
You only get one shot, do
not miss your chance to blow

55
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,400
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

56
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,701
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage

57
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:13,804
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged

58
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:16,405
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed

59
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:19,512
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

60
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:22,403
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher

61
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:25,104
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper

62
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,907
All the pain inside amplified by the

63
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:30,612
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to

64
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,411
Five and I can't provide the right type of

65
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:37,700
Life for my family 'cause man, these
God damn food stamps don't buy diapers

66
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:40,405
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer

67
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:43,216
This is my life and these times are so hard

68
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:46,413
And it's getting even harder
tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus

69
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:50,010
See dishonor caught up between
bein' a father and a prima-donna

70
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,403
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much

71
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:55,512
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not

72
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:58,313
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got

73
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,098
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot

74
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:04,703
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not

75
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:09,508
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got
to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot

76
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:10,903
So here I go is my shot

77
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:14,912
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe
the only opportunity that I got

78
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,807
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

79
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,608
You own it, you better never let it go

80
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,609
You only get one shot, do
not miss your chance to blow

81
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:26,110
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

82
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:29,015
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

83
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,702
You own it, you better never let it go

84
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:34,811
You only get one shot, do
not miss your chance to blow

85
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:38,704
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

86
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,505
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

87
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:53,516
