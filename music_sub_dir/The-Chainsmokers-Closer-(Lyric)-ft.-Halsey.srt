00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:14,803
Hey, I was doing just fine
before I met you

1
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:16,010
I drink too much

2
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:20,013
And that's an issue, but I'm okay

3
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:23,202
Hey, you tell your friends

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,609
It was nice to meet them

5
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:31,602
But I hope I never see them again

6
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,113
I know it breaks your heart

7
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,400
Moved to the city in a broke-down car

8
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,001
And four years, no calls

9
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:40,500
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar

10
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:45,313
And I-I-I can't stop

11
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:50,416
No, I-I-I can't stop

12
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:52,513
So, baby, pull me closer

13
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:55,016
In the backseat of your Rover

14
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:57,405
That I know you can't afford

15
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,100
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

16
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:02,607
Pull the sheets right off the corner

17
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:05,106
Of the mattress that you stole

18
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:07,607
From your roommate back in Boulder

19
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:15,806
We ain't ever getting older

20
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:26,605
We ain't ever getting older

21
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:31,410
We ain't ever getting older

22
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,709
You look as good as the day I met you

23
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:41,212
I forget just why I left you,
I was insane

24
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:45,505
Stay and play that Blink-182 song

25
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:52,304
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

26
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,709
I know it breaks your heart

27
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:56,300
Moved to the city in a broke-down car

28
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:58,603
And four years, no call

29
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:01,216
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,099
And I-I-I can't stop

31
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:11,006
No, I-I-I can't stop

32
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:13,303
So, baby, pull me closer

From your room may back in Boulder

39
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:36,704
We ain't ever getting older

40
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:47,411
We ain't ever getting older

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

We ain't ever getting older

51
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:16,510
(No, we ain't ever getting older)

52
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:19,001
We ain't ever getting older
