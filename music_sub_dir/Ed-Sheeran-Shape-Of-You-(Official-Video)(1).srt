0
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:12,213
The club isn't the best place
to find a lover

1
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:14,902
So the bar is where I go

2
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,207
Me and my friends at the table
doing shots

3
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,818
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

4
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:22,413
You come over and start up a
conversation with just me

5
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,806
And trust me I'll give it a chance now

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,009
Take my hand, stop

7
00:00:26,013 --> 00:00:27,212
Put Van The Man on the jukebox

8
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:29,113
And then we start to dance

9
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:30,316
And now I'm singing like

10
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:32,613
Girl, you know I want your love

11
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:35,512
Your love was handmade for
somebody like me

12
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:37,105
Come on now, follow my lead

13
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,704
I may be crazy, don't mind me

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,299
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

15
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:45,402
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,199
Come on now, follow my lead

17
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:51,108
Come, come on now, follow my lead

18
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:53,413
I'm in love with the shape of you

19
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,814
We push and pull like a magnet do

20
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:58,305
Although my heart is falling too

21
00:00:58,507 --> 00:01:00,906
I'm in love with your body

22
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,303
And last night you were in my room

23
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:05,608
And now my bedsheets smell like you

24
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:08,211
Every day discovering
something brand new

25
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,208
I'm in love with your body

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,199
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

27
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,016
I'm in love with your body

28
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:18,005
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

29
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,006
I'm in love with your body

30
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,309
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

31
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:25,212
I'm in love with your body

32
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:28,511
Every day discovering
something brand new

33
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:30,202
I'm in love with the shape of you

34
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:31,913
One week in we let the story begin

35
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,604
We're going out on our first date

36
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:36,017
You and me are thrifty

37
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:37,216
So go all you can eat

38
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:39,715
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

39
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:42,102
We talk for hours and hours
about the sweet and the sour

40
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:44,707
And how your family is doing okay

41
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,308
Leave and get in a taxi, then
kiss in the backseat

42
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:49,217
Tell the driver make the radio play

43
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:50,402
And I'm singing like

44
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:52,315
Girl, you know I want your love

45
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:55,410
Your love was handmade for
somebody like me

46
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:57,117
Come on now, follow my lead

47
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:59,608
I may be crazy, don't mind me

48
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,309
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

49
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:05,416
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,199
Come on now, follow my lead

51
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:11,012
Come, come on now, follow my lead

52
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:13,403
I'm in love with the shape of you

53
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:15,810
We push and pull like a magnet do

54
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:18,305
Although my heart is falling too

55
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:20,706
I'm in love with your body

56
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:23,217
And last night you were in my room

57
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,598
And now my bedsheets smell like you

58
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,205
Every day discovering

I'm in love with your body

60
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:32,905
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

61
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,910
I'm in love with your body

62
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:38,205
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

63

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on
