Just
this

we
saw
more
peo

for
un

ploy
ment
than
at
any
time
in
the
last
twenty
-
six
years
and
ex

agree
that
if
noth

is
done
the
un

could
reach
dou

its
Our

could
fall
$1
tril

short
of
its
full

which
trans

into
more
than
$12,000
in
lost
in
come
for
a
fam

And
we
could
lose
a
gen

a

of

ten

as
more
young
Amer
i

are
forced
to
forgo

or
the
chance
to

of

In

if
we
do
not
act
boldly
and
swiftly
a
bad

on

I

It's
a
plan
that

save

three

and
one
that
rec

both

the

And
one
of

is
en
sur

that
the
foods
we

and
the

don't
cause

That's
the
mis

of
our

Ad

and
it
is
a
mis

shared
by
our
Depart

and
a

of
other

and
of

at

of

The
men
and
women
who
in
spect
our

and
test
the
safety
of
our
medicines
are
chemists
and
physi
cians
vet
eri
nar
i
ans
and
phar
ma

It's
be
cause
of
the
work
they
do
each
and
ev
ery
day
that
the
United
States
is
one
of
the
safest
places
in
the
world
to
buy
gro

at
a

Un
like
cit
i

of

many

Amer

can
trust
that
there
is
a
strong

to

that
the
med

we
give
our

will

and
that
a
fam
ily
din

won't
end
in
a

to
the

of

But
in
re
cent

we
've
seen
a
num
ber
of
prob

with
the

mak
ing
its

to
our

In

it

In

it
was

And
just
this
year
bad
peanut
prod

led
to
hun
dreds
of
ill

and
cost
nine
peo
ple
their

--
a
painful
re

of
how
tragic
the

can
be
when
food
pro

and
gov

is
un

Worse
these
in

re

a

that's

nearly
350
a

--
up
from
100
a
year
in
the
early
1990s
Part
of
the
rea
son
is
that
many
of
the
laws
and
reg
u
la

gov
ern

in
Amer

have
not
been
up

since
they
were

in

of
Teddy
Roo

It's
also
be
cause
our
sys

of
in
spec

and
en
force
ment
is
spread
out
so
widely
among
so
many
peo

that
it's
dif
fi
cult
for
dif
fer
ent
parts
of
our
gov

ment
to
share
in
for
ma
tion
work
to
gether
and
solve
prob

And
it's
also
be
cause
the
FDA
has
been
un

funded
and
un
der
staffed
in
re
cent
years
leav
ing
the

with
the

spect
just
7,000

our
150,000

each

That
means
roughly
95

unin

That

I

I

the

be

we
know
that
the
suc

of
Amer

is
in
ex

bly
linked
to
that
of
the
global

If
peo

in

can
not
spend
that
means
they
can
not
buy
the
goods
we
pro
duce
here
in
Amer

which
means
more
lost
jobs
and
more
fam

Just
yes
ter

we
learned
that
we
lost
hun

of

last

adding
to
the

we

Ul

the
only
way
out
of

that

is
with
a

that
is

That
is
why
I'm
pleased
that
af

All

All

Fi

I

in

That
is
where
al

trains

to

And
that

As
we
have
worked
this

to
find

and
strengthen

we
have
not

all
of

And
we

But
we
have
made

un

and
will
con

to

so
in
the
weeks

Be

in

The

That

Hi,

As

my

is
re

an

where
ev

who
works
hard
has
the
chance
to
get

That's
what
I'll
spend
some

talk

on
Mon

at

We

about
the

how
we
can
ad

Take

Many

don't

ad

to

so
work

can't
af

to
be

when
their

needs
them
the
most
That's
wrong
And
it
puts
us
way
be
hind
the
times
Only
three
coun

in
the
world
re
port
that
they
don't
of

Three
And
the
United
States
is
one
of
them
It's
time
to
change
that
A
few
states
have
acted
on
their
own
to
give
work
ers
paid
fam
ily
leave
but
this
should
be
avail
able
to
ev

be
cause
all
Amer

should
be
able
to

to

for
a

mem

Child

is
an
other
chal
lenge
Most
work

fam

I
know
can't
af
ford
thou
sands
a
year
for
child
care
but
of
ten
that's
what
it
costs
That
leaves
par

scram

just
to
make
sure
their

are
safe
while
they
're
at

--
for

the

qual

early
child
hood

u
ca

that
helps
kids
suc

in

Then
there's
the
is
sue
of
flex
i
bil

--
the
abil

to
take
a
few
hours
off
for
a
par
ent
-
teacher
con
fer
ence
or
to
work
from
home
when
your
kid
is
sick
Most
work
ers
want
it,
but
not
enough
of
them
have
it.
What's
more
it
not
only
makes
work
ers
hap

stud

show
that
flex
i

can
make

and
re

and
ab

That's
good
for
busi

At
a
time
when
women
make
up
about
half
of
Amer
ica's
work
force
out
dated
work
place
poli

that
make
it
harder
for
moth

to

hold
our
en

But
these
aren't
just
prob

for
women
Men
also
care
about
who's

ing
their

They
're
re

Lots
of

And
plenty
of
fa
thers
would
love
to
be
home
for
their
new
baby's
first

in
the
world
In
fact
in
a
new

nearly
half
of
all

women
and

-
re

that
they
've
said

they
didn't

but
be

would
be

When

But

have
de

that
the

it's

None

It's

that

come

than
al

any

on

But
there's
an
other
trend
that
threat
ens
to
un
der
mine
the
progress
you
've
helped
make
Even
as
cor

as
ever
a

ing
group
of

are

ing
the
coun

to
get
out
of
pay
ing

They
're
keep
ing
most
of
their

in
side
the
United

but
they
're
ba
si

re

their

zen
ship
and
declar
ing
that
they
're
based
some
where
else
just
to
avoid
pay
ing
their
fair

I
want
to
be
clear:
this
is
only
a
few
big
cor
po
ra

so
The
vast
ma
jor
ity
of
Amer
i
can
busi

pay
their
taxes
right
here
in

United

But
when
some

cher
ryp
ick
their

it
dam
ages
the
coun

fi

It
adds
to
the
deficit
It
makes
it
harder
to
in
vest
in
the
things
that
will
keep
Amer
ica
strong
and
it
sticks
you
with
the
tab
for
what
they
stash
off
shore
Right
a
loop
hole
in
our
tax
laws
makes
this
to
tally
le
gal
--
and
I
think
that's
to
tally
wrong
You
don't
get
to
pick
which
rules
you
play
by,
or
which
tax
rate
you
and
nei
ther
should
these
com
pa

The
best
way
to
level
the
play
ing
field
is
through
tax
re
form
that
low
ers
the
cor
po
rate
tax
rate
closes
waste
ful
loop
holes
and
sim

fies
the

Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
spent
some
time
in
Colorado
and
Texas
talk
ing
with
peo
ple
about
what's
go
ing
on
in
their
lives
One
of
them
was
El
iz
a
beth
Cooper
who
'll
be
a
col
lege
ju
nior
this
fall
She
wrote
to
tell
me
some
thing
I
hear
of
ten:
how
hard
it
is
for
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
like
hers
to
af
ford
col

And
she
shared
some
thing
I
know
many
of
you
feel
when
you
won
der
what's
go
ing
on
in
Wash
ing
ton
She
said
she
feels
"not
sig
nif
i
cant
enough
to
be
ad
dressed
not
poor
enough
for
peo
ple
to
worry
about
and
not
rich
enough
to
be
cared
about."
I
ran
for
Pres
i
dent
to
fight
for
Amer
i
cans
just
like
El
iz
a
beth
-
peo
ple
who
work
hard
do
ev
ery
thing
right
and
just
want
a
chance
to
build
a
de
cent
life
for
them
selves
and
their
fam
i
lies
And
af
ter
the
worst
eco
nomic
cri
sis
in
gen
er
a
tions
our
busi
nesses
have
now
cre
ated
nearly
10
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
past
52
months
The
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
has
fallen
to
its
low
est
point
since
2008
By
al
most
ev
ery
mea
sure
our
econ
omy
is
bet
ter
off
than
it
was
five
years
But
while
we
've
cre
ated
more
jobs
at
this
point
of
the
year
than
any
year
since
1999
too
many
fam
i
lies
barely
earn
what
they
did
in
1999
It's
harder
to
pay
for
col
lege
save
or
re
tire
be
cause
peo
ple's
wages
and
in
comes
have
not
gone
up.
Nearly
all
the
gains
of
the
re
cov
ery
are
go
ing
to
the
very
top
-
and
aren't
mak
ing
a
dif
fer
ence
in

And
I
be
lieve
Amer
ica
does
bet
ter
when
the
mid

does
bet

And
I've
laid
out
an
op
por
tu

agenda
to
cre
ate
jobs
train
work
ers
ed
u
cate
our
kids
and
make
sure
hard
work
ac
tu

pays
Th
ese
are
the
things
we
should
be
do
ing
to
grow
the
mid
dle
class
and
help
folks
work
their
way
into
the
mid
dle
class
And
it's
pretty
un
con
tro
ver
sial
stuff
I
hope
we
can
work
to
gether
on
it.
And
I'm
al
ways
will
ing
to
com
pro
mise
if
folks
have
other
ideas
or
if
it
ad
vances
gen
er
ally
the
in

of

ing
Amer
i
cans
But
so
far
this
year
Repub

cans
in
Congress
have
blocked
ev

se
ri
ous
idea
to
strengthen
the
mid

Lift

the
min
i
mum
wage
fair

re

-
they
've
said
no

all
of

And
that's
when
I've
acted
this
year
to
help
work
ing
Amer
i

on
my
own-
when
Congress
won't
I've
taken
ac

lift

pay

And
the
Repub

plan
right
now
is
not
to
do
some
of
this
work
with

-
in

it's
to
sue
me.
That's
ac
tu

what
they
're
spend

on.
It's
a
po

i

stunt
that's
go

to

of

And
by

And
in
many
ways
that's
Amer

story
these
past
five
years
We
are
a
strong

knit
fam

that's
made

with

we

The
prob

keeps

And
as

as

we

The
Pres

Hi,
ev
ery
body
On
Fri
day
I
vis
ited
Fort
Bliss
in
Texas
where
I
met
with
some
of
our
ex
tra
or
di
nary
men
and
women
in
uni
form
to
mark
the
sec
ond
an
niver
sary
of
the
end
of
ma
jor
com
bat
in
Iraq
It
was
a
chance
to
thank
our
troops
for
the
out
stand
ing
work
they
've
done
over
the
last
decade
Fort
Bliss
is
home
to
sol
diers
who
took
part
in
ev
ery
ma
jor
phase
of
the
Iraq
War
--
from
the
ini
tial
as
sault
on
Bagh
dad;
to
the
years
of
fight
ing
block
by
block;
to
the
part
ner
ship
with
the
Iraqi
peo
ple
that
helped
give
them
a
chance
to
forge
their
own
des
tiny
And
while
the
war
it
self
re
mains
a
source
of
con
tro
versy
here
at
home
one
thing
will
never
be
in
doubt
--
the
mem
bers
of
our
armed
forces
are
pa
tri
ots
in
ev
ery
sense
of
the
word
They
met
ev
ery
mis
sion
and
per
formed
ev
ery
task
that
was
asked
of
them
with
pre
ci
sion
com
mit
ment
and
skill
And
with
no
Amer
i
cans
fight
ing
in
Iraq
it's
my
priv
i
lege
on
be
half
of
a
grate
ful
na
tion
to
once
again
con
grat
u
late
these
men
and
women
on
a
job
well
done
This
an
niver
sary
is
a
chance
to
ap
pre
ci
ate
how
far
we
've
come
But
it's
also
a
re
minder
that
there
is
still
dif
fi
cult
work
ahead
of
us
in
Afghanistan
Some
of
the
sol
diers
I
met
at
Fort
Bliss
had
just
come
home
from
the
bat
tle
field
and
oth
ers
were
get
ting
ready
to
ship
We
've
bro
ken
the
Tal
iban's
mo
men
tum
in
Afghanistan
and
be
gun
the
tran
si
tion
to
an
Afghan
lead
Next
month
the
last
of
the
troops
I
or
dered
as
part
of
the
surge
against
the
Tal
iban
will
come
home
and
by
2014
the
tran
si
tion
to
Afghan
lead
will
be
com
plete
But
as
long
as
we
have
a
sin
gle
Amer
i
can
in
harm's
we
will
con
tinue
to
do
ev
ery
thing
in
our
power
to
keep
them
safe
and
help
them
suc
ceed
That
means
giv
ing
them
a
clear
mis
sion
and
the
equip
ment
they
need
on
the
front
lines
But
it
also
means
tak
ing
care
of
our
vet
er
ans
and
their
fam
i
lies
Be
cause
no
one
who
fights
for
this
coun
try
should
have
to
fight
for
a
job
or
a
roof
over
their
head
when
they
come
home
I
also
told
our
sol
diers
at
Bliss
that
part
of
hon
or
ing
their
ser
vice
means
strength
en
ing
the
na
tion
they
fought
so
hard
to
pro
tect
As
we
turn
the
page
on
a
decade
of
it's
time
to
do
some
na
tion
-
build
ing
here
at
home
My
grand
fa
ther's
gen
er
a
tion
came
back
from
World
War
II
and
helped
form
the
back
bone
of
the
great
est
mid
dle
-
class
in
his
tory
They
helped
this
coun
try
come
back
stronger
than
be
fore
To
day's
vet
er
ans
have
the
skills
the
dis
ci
pline
and
the
lead
er
ship
skills
to
do
the
ex
act
same
thing
--
and
it's
our
job
to
give
them
that
chance
It's
time
to
build
a
na
tion
that
lives
up
to
the
ideals
that
so
many
Amer
i
cans
have
fought
for
--
a
na
tion
where
they
can
re
al
ize
the
dream
they
sac
ri
ficed
to
pro
tect
We
need
to
re
build
our
roads
and
run
ways
and
ports
We
need
to
lay
broad
band
lines
across
this
coun
try
and
put
our
vet
er
ans
back
to
work
as
cops
and
fire
fight
ers
in
com
mu
ni
ties
that
need
them
And
we
need
to
come
to
gether
to
make
Amer
ica
a
place
where
hard
work
is
re
warded
and
any
one
will
ing
to
put
in
the
ef
fort
can
make
it
if
they
That's
how
we
can
honor
our
troops
That's
the
wel
come
home
they
've
earned
Thanks
and
have
a
great

The
Pres
i

Hi
there
As
you
can
I
brought
a
few
things
with
me
for
this
week's
video
A
pad
lock
A
pair
of
boots
A
can
dle
And
a
pair
of
socks
We
are
not
hav
ing
a
yard
sale
And
these
prod
ucts
may
not
ap
pear
to
have
much
in
com
mon
But
they
're
united
by
three
proud
words:
"Made
in
Amer
i
ca."
They
're
man
u
fac
tured
by
Amer
i
can
work
ers
in
Amer
i
can
fac
to

and
shipped
to
cus
tomers
here
and
around
the
world
The
com
pa
nies
that
make
these
prod

are
part
of
a
hope
ful
trend:
they
're
bring
ing
jobs
back
from
over

You
've
heard
of
out
sourc
ing
--
well
this
is
in
sourc
ing
And
in
this
make
or
break
mo
ment
for
the
mid

class
and
those
work
ing
to
get
into
the
mid
dle
class
that's
ex
actly
the
kind
of
com
mit
ment
to
coun
try
that
we
need
This
week
I
in
vited
ex
ec
u
tives
from
busi
nesses
that
are
in
sourc
ing
jobs
to
a
fo
rum
at
the
White
House
Th
ese
are
CEOs
who
take
pride
in
hir
ing
peo
ple
here
in
Amer
ica
not
just
be
cause
it's
in
creas
ingly
the
right
thing
to
do
for
their
bot
tom
line
but
also
be
cause
it's
the
right
thing
to
do
for
their
work
ers
and
for
our
com
mu
ni
ties
and
for
our
coun
try
I
told
those
CEOs
what
I'll
tell
any
busi
ness
lead
er:
ask
your
self
what
you
can
do
to
bring
more
jobs
back
to
the
coun
try
that
made
your
suc
cess
pos
si
ble
And
I'll
make
sure
that
you
've
got
a
gov
ern
ment
that
does
ev
ery
thing
in
its
power
to
help
you
suc
ceed
That's
in
the
next
few
weeks
I
will
put
for
ward
new
tax
pro
pos
als
that
re
ward
com
pa
nies
that
choose
to
do
the
right
thing
by
bring

jobs
home
and
in
vest
ing
in
Amer
ica
--
and
will
elim
i
nate
tax
breaks
for
com
pa
nies
that
move
jobs
over
seas
It's
also
why
on
Fri
day
I
called
on
Congress
to
help
me
make
gov
ern
ment
work
bet
ter
for
Right
we
have
a
21st
cen
tury
econ

but
we
've
still
got
a
gov

or
ga

for
the
20th

tury
Over
the
years
the
needs
of
Amer
i
cans
have
changed
but
our
gov
ern
ment
has
In
fact
it's
got
ten
even
more
com
plex
And
that
has
to
change
That's
why
I
asked
Congress
to
re
in
state
the
au
thor
ity
that
past
pres
i
dents
have
had
to
stream
line
and
re
form
the
Ex

This
is
the

sort
of

that
ev

busi

owner
has
to
make
sure
that
his

It's
the

au

that

had
for
over
50
years
--
un

And
let
me
be
clear:
I
will
only
use
this
au

for

that
re

in
more
ef

bet

and
a

Th

changes
will
make
it
eas

for

own

to
get
the
loans
and
sup
port
they

For

One

where

can
go

to

they

And
in

Great
Re

sion
It's
changed
to
the
point
where
even
when
folks
have
jobs;
even
when
the
econ
omy
is
grow
ing;
it's
harder
for
hard
work
ing
fam
i
lies
to
pull
them
selves
out
of
poverty
harder
for
young
peo
ple
to
start
out
on
their
ca
reers
and
tougher
for
work
ers
to
re
tire
when
they
want
to.
That's
a
big
part
of
the
rea
son
a
lot
of
work
ing
fam
i
lies
are
feel
ing
anx
ious
And
it
of
fends
our
fun
da
men
tally
Amer
i
can
be
lief
that
ev
ery
body
who
works
hard
should
be
able
to
get
ahead
That's
why
we
've
been
fight
ing
so
hard
to
give

i

more
op
por

and
more
se

-
by
work
ing
to
cre
ate
more
good
jobs
in

in
our
mid
dle
class
and
help
work
ing
peo
ple
get
a
raise
It's
what
the
Af
ford
able
Care
Act
is
all
about
-
fill
ing
in
the
gaps
in
em
ployer
-
based
care
so
that
when
some
body
loses
a
or
goes
back
to
school
or
starts
that
new
busi
ness
they
still
have
health
care
And
it's
why
I
be
lieve
we
've
got
to
take
steps
to
mod
ern
ize
our
un
em

If
a
hard
work
ing
Amer
i
can
loses
her
re
gard
less
of
what
state
she
lives
in,
we
should
make
sure
she
can
get
un
em
ploy
ment
in
sur
ance
and
some
help
to
re
train
for
her
next
If
she's
been
un
em
ployed
for
a
while
we
should
reach
out
to
her
and
con
nect
her
with
ca
reer
coun
sel
ing
And
if
she
finds
a
new
job
that
doesn't
pay
as
much
as
her
old
we
should
of
fer
some
wage
in
sur
ance
that
helps
her
pay
her
bills
Un
der
my
plan
ex
pe
ri
enced
work
ers
who
now
make
less
than
$50,000
could
re
place
half
of
their
lost
wages
-
up
to
$10,000
over
two
years
It's
a
way
to
give
fam
i
lies
some
sta
bil
ity
and
en
cour
age
folks
to
re
join
the
work
force
-
be
cause
we
shouldn't
just
be
talk
ing
about
un
em
ploy
ment;
we
should
be
talk
ing
about
re
-
em
ploy
ment
That's
when
Amer
ica
works
best
-
when
ev
ery
one
has
op
por
tu

when
ev
ery

has
some
se
cu
ri

and
when
ev
ery
one
can
con
trib
ute
to
this
coun
try
we
love
That's
how
we
make
sure
that
hard
work
ing
fam
i

can
get
ahead
And
that's
what
I'll
be
fight

A

I
re

a

from
a

named
Brenda
Breece
I
wanted
to

Wash

Brenda's
a

and
a

from
Mis

Her
hus
band
David
was
em
ployed
at
the
lo

Chrysler

for
nearly
four
decades
They
've
worked
hard
their
whole
lives
But
like
a
lot
of
folks
they
've
taken
some
hits
over
the
past
few
years
When
the
Chrysler
plant
closed
David
had
to
take
early
re
tire
ment
His
pen
sion
helps
but
it's
half
of
what
he
earned
be
fore
Mean
while
be
cause
of

get
cuts
Brenda
has
had
to
buy
school
sup
plies
for
her
stu
dents
out
of
her
own
pocket
--
be
cause
it's
her
job
and
she
cares
about
those
kids
Money
has
been
tight
but
they
're
do
ing
the
best
they
And
like
so
many
fam
i
lies
they
are
sac
ri
fic
ing
what
they
don't
need
so
they
can
af
ford
what
re
ally
mat
ters
This
is
what
Brenda
told
me.
"I
feel
my
fam
ily
is
fru
gal
"We
go
to
the
movies...once
a
month
but
usu
ally
we
just
wait
for
them
to
come
out

I
watch
the
food
bud

com
bine
trips
into

[and]
use
coupons
...
and
we
trim
each
other's
hair
when
we
need
a
hair
cut."
So
Brenda
and
her
hus
band
know
what
they
can
do
with
out
But
they
also
know
what
in
vest

are

Their

The

But
it's
worth
it,
be
cause
it
will
give
her
the
chance
to
achieve
her

In

Brenda
is
look

for
a

to
en

as
she
put
it,
"the

we

And
there
are
real

that
our

more

over

last

than

But
this

we
also
re
ceived
the
first
es

over
the

And
it
re
minded
us
that

in

can
get

We
all
agree
that
it's

But
we
can't
just
cut
our
way
to

It
hasn't
worked
in
the
past
and
it
won't
work
to

It
could
slow
down

It
could
weaken
our

And
it
could
cost

not

in

What
we
need
in

is
a

an

that
says
let's

Al

Repub

Democrats
have
worked
to

to

That's
a

But
to
get
the
rest
of
the

need
a
bal
anced
set
of

For

the

But
that

The

For

the

more

than
it
takes

The
re

is
a

of

on

--
debt
that
un
less
we
act
will
weaken
our

cause
higher

est

for

and
force
us
to

things
like

Medi

folks
in
Wash

like
to

for

But
the
truth
is,
nei
ther

is
blame
less
And
both
par

have
a
re

si
bil

to
do
some
thing
about
it.
Every

are

how

It's
time
for
Wash

to
do
the

But
for
that
to
hap
pen
it
means
that
Democrats
and
Repub

have

It
means
we
need
to
put

our

what's

Every

Other

That's
why
we

We

And
we
need
an

that

So
that
means
we
have
to
make

but
that
it's
not

to

be

It

This

So

I

This

To

With
this

they

98%
of

-
leav

them
with
a

of
what
it

With

so
they

So
this
deal
ac
tu
ally
pushes
Iran
fur
ther
away
from
a
bomb
And
there's
a
per
ma
nent
pro
hi
bi
tion
on
Iran
ever
hav

a

Se
cond
you
might
hear
from
crit
ics
that
Iran
could
just
ig
nore
what's
re
quired
and
do
what
ever
they
want
That
they
're
in
evitably
go

to

Well
that's
wrong
With
this

we
will
have

Iran's

in

The
ver
i
fi
ca

process
set
up
by
this
deal
is
com
pre
hen
sive
and
it
is
in
tru

-
pre
cisely
so
we
can
make
sure
Iran
keeps
its
com
mit

Third
you
might
hear
from
crit
ics
that
Iran
faces
no
con
se
quences
if
it
vi
o
lates
this
deal
That's
also
patently
false
If
Iran
vi
o
lates
this

the
sanc

we
im
posed
that
have
helped
crip
ple
the
Ira
nian
econ

-
the
sanc

that
helped
make
this
deal
pos

-
would
snap
back
into

promptly
There's
a
rea
son
this
deal
took
so
long
to
ne
go
ti
ate
Be
cause
we
re
fused
to
ac
cept
a
bad
deal
We
held
out
for
a
deal
that
met
ev
ery
one
of
our
bot
tom
lines
And
we
got
it.
Does
this
deal
re
solve
all
of
the
threats
Iran
poses
to
its
neigh
bors
and
the
world?
No.
Does
it
do
more
than
any
one
has
done
be
fore
to
make
sure
Iran
does
not
ob
tain
a
nu
clear
weapon?
And
that
was
our
top
pri
or
ity
from
the
start
That's
why
it's
in
ev
ery
one's
best
in
ter
est
to
make
sure
this
deal
holds
Be
cause
with
out
this

there
would
be
no

Iran's

There
would
be
no

The
sanc

we
ral
lied
the
world
to

would
un

Iran
could
move
closer
to
a
nu

Other
coun

in

might
race
to
do
the
same
And
we'd
risk
an
other
war
in
the
most
volatile
re

in
the
world
That's
what
would
hap

with

On

we

We

The

To
day
we
pause
to
re
mem
ber
a
day
that
tested
our
coun
try
On
Septem
ber
11,
2001
nearly
3,000
lives
were
lost
in
the
dead
li
est
at
tack
on
Amer
i
can
soil
in
our
his

We
will
never
for
get
the
im
ages
of
planes
van
ish
ing
into
build
ings;
of
pho
tos
hung
by
the
fam
i
lies
of
the
miss

We
will
never
for
get
the
anger
and
the
sad
ness
that
we
felt
And
while
nine
years
have
come
and
gone
since
that
Septem
ber
morn
ing
the
pas
sage
of
time
will
never
di
min
ish
the
pain
and
loss
for
ever
seared
in
the
con
scious
ness
of
our
na

That's
on
this
we
pray
with
the
fam
i
lies
of
those
who
died
We
mourn
with
the
hus
bands
and
wives
the
chil
dren
and
par
ents
friends
and
loved
ones
We
think
about
the
mile
stones
that
have
passed
over
the
course
of
nine
years
--
births
and
chris
ten
ings
wed
dings
and
grad
u
a
tions
--
all
with
an
empty
chair
On
this
we
also
honor
those
who
died
so
that
oth
ers
might
live:
the
fire
fight
ers
and
first
re
spon
ders
who
climbed
the
stairs
of
two
burn
ing
tow
ers;
the
pas
sen
gers
who
stormed
a
cock
pit;
and
the
men
and
women
who
have
in
the
years
since
borne
the
uni
form
of
this
coun
try
and
given
their
lives
so
that
our
chil
dren
could
grow
up
in
a
safer
world
In
acts
of
courage
and
de
cency
they
de
fended
a
sim
ple
pre
cept:
I
am
my
brother's
keep
er;
I
am
my
sis
ter's
keeper
And
on
this
we
re
call
that
at
our
dark
est
mo
ment
we
sum
moned
a
sense
of
unity
and
com
mon
pur
pose
We
re
sponded
to
the
worst
kind
of
de
prav
ity
with
the
best
of
our
hu
man
ity
So,
each
year
at
this
time
we
re
new
our
re
solve
against
those
who
per
pe
trated
this
bar
baric
act
of
ter
ror
and
who
con
tinue
to
plot
against
us
--
for
we
will
never
wa
ver
in
de
fense
of
this
na

We
re
new
our
com
mit
ment
to
our
troops
and
all
who
serve
to
pro
tect
this
coun
try
and
to
their
fam
i
lies
But
we
also
re
new
the
true
spirit
of
that
Not
the
hu
man
ca
pac
ity
for
evil
but
the
hu
man
ca
pac
ity
for
good
Not
the
de
sire
to
de
stroy
but
the
im
pulse
to
save
That's
why
we
mark
Septem
ber
11th
as
a
Na
tional
Day
of
Ser
vice
and
Re
mem
brance
For
if
there
is
a
les
son
to
be
drawn
on
this
an
niver
sary
it
is
this:
we
are
one
na
tion
--
one
peo
ple
--
bound
not
only
by
grief
but
by
a
set
of
com
mon
ideals
And
that
by
giv
ing
back
to
our
com
mu
ni
ties
by
serv
ing
peo
ple
in
need
we
reaf
firm
our
ideals
--
in
de
fi
ance
of
those
who
would
do
us
grave
harm
We
prove
that
the
sense
of
re
spon
si
bil
ity
that
we
felt
for
one
an
other
that
day
nine
years
ago
was
not
a
fleet
ing
pas
sion
--
but
a
last
ing
virtue
This
is
a
dif
fi
cult
time
for
our
coun
try
And
it's
of
ten
in
such
mo
ments
that
some
try
to
stoke
bit
ter
ness
--
to
di
vide
us
based
on
our
dif
fer
ences
to
blind
us
to
what
we
have
in
com
mon
But
on
this
we
are
re
minded
that
at
our
best
we
do
not
give
in
to
this
temp
ta
tion
We
stand
with
one
an
other
We
fight
along
side
one
an
other
We
do
not
al
low
our
selves
to
be
de

by
fear
but
rather
by
the
hopes
we
have
for
our
fam
i
lies
for
our
na
tion
and
for
a
brighter
fu

So
let
us
grieve
for
those
we
've
lost
honor
those
who
have
sac

and
do
our

to

But
it

That's
why
I've
called
on
Congress
to
take

half
of

Every

Hi,

Next

seven

that

for

ing

on
Main

Soon
af

that
I
took

And
we
set
out
to
re

our
econ

on
a

for

To

our

have

more

13

over
the

The

We

Still
in
an

that's
in
creas
ingly
based
on

edge
and
in

some

is
the

to
the

By
the
end
of

two

will

That's
one
rea
son
why
a

from
a

will
earn
you
$10,000
more
each

than
some
one
who
only

One
study
showed
that
a
de

from
a
four

earns
you
$1

The

Will

The
Pres

This

I
spent
some

in

con

talk

who
are
do

their
best
to
cope
with
the
af

math
of
a
bru

re

And
while
I
was
there
a
young
woman
asked
me
a
ques

I
hear
all
the
time:
"What
are
we
do
ing
as
a
na
tion
to
bring
jobs
back
to
this
coun
try?"
Well
on
Fri
day
we
learned
that
af
ter
22
straight
months
of
job
loss
our
econ
omy
has
now
cre
ated
jobs
in
the
pri
vate

for
six

in
a
That's
a
pos
i
tive
sign
But
the
truth
is,
the
re
ces
sion
from
which
we
're
emerg
ing
has
left
us
in
a
hole
that's
about
8
mil
lion
jobs
deep
And
as
I've
said
from
the
day
I
took
of
fice
it's
go
ing
to
take
months
even
years
to
dig
our
way
out
--
and
it's
go
ing
to
re
quire
an
all

hands
-
on

deck
ef

In
the
short

we
're

to
speed
up
this

keep
the

That
means
ex

That
means
get
ting
small
busi
nesses
the
loans
they
need
to
keep
their
doors
open
and
hire
new
work
ers
And
that
means
send
ing
re
lief
to
states
so
they
don't
have
to
lay
off
thou
sands
of
teach
ers
and
fire
fight

and

Still
at

And
too
many

gave

We

where

Be

we

Too

But
while

their

But
even

I
don't

it's

just

we

That's

I've

Hi,
ev

Over
the
last
few

Democrats
and
Repub

have
come
to

and
cut
our
deficit
by
more
than
$2.5

through
a

of

That's

I

And

my

I

But
the

And
right
if

All

And
then
there's

Right
most
Mem

of

in

don't

And
yet

They'd
rather
ask

than

Over

've

to

re

There's
no

we
can't

And
there's
cer
tainly
no

At
a

when

have

we

So
my

to

is
this:
Let's

And
let's

in

will

That's

I

What

I

the

That's
why
we

But
we

Fail

would
in

that

would
fall

it

All

And
this

I

This
will
be
good
for

and
for

We

this
is

Our

Our

have

But
while
those
at
the

are
do

have
barely
budged
Too
many
Amer

are
work
ing
harder
than
ever
just
to
get

let
alone
get
ahead
And
that's
been
true
since
long
be
fore
the

That's
why
we
've
got
to
build
an

that
works

We

The

I've

is

In

I
first
asked

six

that's
worth
about
20

less
than
when
Ron

took

Right
there's
a
bill
in
Congress
that
would
boost
Amer
ica's
min
i
mum
wage
to
$10.10
an

That's
easy
to
re
mem
ber:
ten

And
re

ber
the
av

worker
who
would
get
a

if
Congress
acts
is
about
35
years
Most
lower

wage
jobs
are
held
by
women
And
rais
ing
the
min

mum

wouldn't
just
raise
their
wages
-
its
ef
fect
would
lift

for

28

It
would
lift

with

It
will
give
more

more

with
more

-
and
that
means
grow

I'll

That's

Hi,

This
Father's

I'd
like
to
spend
a
cou

min

talk

about
what's
some

He

I

even

I
were
lucky
enough
to
have
a

I
felt
his
ab

And
I
won
der
what
my
life
would
have
been
like
had
he
been
a
greater
pres

That's
why
I
try
pretty
hard
to
be
a
good
dad
for
my
own
kids
I
haven't
al
ways
suc
ceeded
of
course
--
and
in
the
past
my
job's
kept
me
away
from
home
more
than
I
of
ten
would
've
liked
and
the
bur
den
of
rais
ing
two
young

some
times
would
fall
too

on

But
be

up,
and
my
on
go
ing
ef
forts
to
be
the
best
fa
ther
I
can
be,
I've
learned
a
cou
ple
of
things
about
what
our
chil
dren
need
most
from
their
par
ents
First
and
fore
most
they
need
our
time
And
more
im
por
tant
than
the
quan
tity
of
hours
we
spend
with
them
is
the
qual
ity
of
those
hours
Maybe
it's
just
ask
ing
about
their
or
talk
ing
a
walk
to
gether
but
the
small
est
mo

can
have
the
big
gest
im

They
also
need

And
above
chil

need
our
un

whether
they
suc
ceed
or
make
mis

when
life
is
easy
and
when

is
tough
And
life
is
tough
for
a
lot
of
Amer
i

to

More
and
more

grow
up
with
out
a

Others
miss
a

And
even
for
those
dads
who
are
present
in
their
chil
dren's
lives
the
re
ces
sion
has
taken
a
harsh
toll
If

That's

All

And
all

But
more

So
re

I
took
on

as

for

On
Sun

we'd
get
the
team
to

to
prac

and
a
cou

of
times
I'd
help
coach
the
games
And
it
was
great
fun
--
even
if
Sasha
rolled
her
eyes
oc
ca

ally
when
her

voiced
his
dis

sure
with

But
I
was
so

watch

down

her
learn
and
im
prove
and

And
I
was
hope
ful
that
in

years
to
come
she'd
look
back
on
ex

like
these
as
the

that
helped
de

and

In
the
that's
what
be

is
all
about
--
those
pre

with
our

that
fill

with

and
ex

the

the
op

to

Hi

Fourth

We

And

what
our
In

Day
is
all
about
-
what
hap
pened
237
years
and
what
it
meant
to
the
world
On
July
1776
a
small
band
of
pa
tri
ots
de
clared
that
we
were
a
peo
ple
cre
ated
equal
-
free
to
think
and
wor
ship
and
live
as
we
please
It
was
a
dec
la
ra
tion
heard
around
the
world
-
that
we
were
no
longer
colonists
we
were
Amer
i
cans
and
our
des
tiny
would
not
be
de
ter
mined
for
us;
it
would
be
de
ter
mined
by
us.
It
was
a
bold
and
tremen
dously
brave
thing
to
do.
It
was
also
nearly
un
think
able
At
that
time
kings
and
princes
and
em
per
ors
ruled
the
world
But
those
pa
tri
ots
were
cer
tain
that
a
bet
ter
way
was
pos
si
ble
And
to
achieve
it
-
to
win
their
free
dom
-
they
were
will
ing
to
lay
it
all
on
the
line
Their
lives
Their
for
tunes
Their
sa
cred
honor
They
fought
a
rev

Few
would
have
bet
on
our
side
to
But
for
the
first
of
many
times
to
come
Amer
ica
proved
the
doubters
wrong
And
237
years
later
the
United

-
this

that

more

That's

even

A

And
many

So
al

this

not

The

But
over
the
long

the
only
way
we

to

And
I

But
I

I

2014

Four

This

but
around

it

And
the

The

The

ev

three

we

And
be

the

there's

This

It's

It's
about
keep

This

And

the

of

or

They
wanted

as
Amer

we
refuse
to

in

Yes
we
face
a

mined
and
make
no
mis

--
they
will
keep

to

again
But
as
we

again
this

we
re

We

And
no
mat
ter
what

as

carry

They
wanted
to
draw
us
in
to
end
less

sap
ping

and
con

as
a

But
even
as

we

end

the

in

and

Be

af

a

of

They
wanted
to

of

But
we

We

to
the

that

unique
among

And
they
wanted
to
un
der
mine
our
place
in
the

But
a
decade
later
we
've
shown
that
Amer

doesn't
hun

down
and
hide

of

We
've
forged

around

to

that

Ten

Amer

showed
us
the
true
mean

of
courage
when
they
rushed
up
those

into

In

In

We

The
Pres
i
dent:
This
week
we
mark
the
eleventh
an
niver
sary
of
the
Septem
ber
11th
at
tacks
It's
a
time
to
re
mem
ber
the
nearly
3,000
in
no
cent
women
and
chil
dren
we
lost
and
the
fam
i
lies
that
they
left
be
hind
It's
a
chance
to
honor
the
courage
of
the
first
re
spon
ders
who
risked
their
lives
--
on
that
and
ev
ery
day
since
And
it's
an
op
por
tu
nity
to
give
thanks
for
our
men
and
women
in
uni
form
who
have
served
and
sac
ri
ficed
some
times
far
from
home
to
keep
our
coun
try
safe
This
an
niver
sary
is
about
them
It's
also
a
time
to
re
flect
on
just
how
far
we
've
come
as
a
na
tion
these
past
eleven
years
On
that
clear
Septem
ber
morn
ing
as
Amer
ica
watched
the
tow
ers
fall
and
the
Pen
tagon
burn
and
the
wreck
age
smol
der
ing
in
a
Penn
syl
va
nia
field
we
were
filled
with
ques
tions
Where
had
the
at
tacks
come
from
and
how
would
Amer
ica
re
spond?
Would
they
fun
da
men
tally
weaken
the
coun
try
we
love?
Would
they
change
who
we
are?
The
last
decade
has
been
a
dif
fi
cult
but
to
gether
we
have
an
swered
those
ques
tions
and
come
back
stronger
as
a
na
tion
We
took
the
fight
to
al
Qaeda
dec
i
mat
ing
their
lead
er
ship
and
put
them
on
the
path
to
de
feat
And
thanks
to
the
courage
and
skill
of
our
in
tel
li
gence
per
son
nel
and
armed
forces
Osama
bin
Laden
will
never
threaten
Amer
ica
again
In
stead
of
pulling
back
from
the
world
we
've
strength
ened
our
al
liances
while
im
prov
ing
our
se
cu
rity
here
at
home
As
Amer
i
cans
we
refuse
to
live
in
fear
To
day
a
new
tower
rises
above
the
New
York
sky
line
And
our
coun
try
is
stronger
safer
and
more
re
spected
in
the
world
In
stead
of
turn
ing
on
each
other
we
've
re
sisted
the
temp
ta
tion
to
give
in
to
mis
trust
and
sus
pi

I've
al
ways
said
that
Amer
ica
is
at
war
with
al
Qaeda
and
its
af
fil
i
ates
--
and
we
will
never
be
at

with
Is
lam
or
any

re

We
are
the
United
States
of
Amer

Our
free
dom
and
di
ver
sity
make
us
unique
and
they
will
al
ways
be
cen
tral
to
who
we
are
as
a
na

In
stead
of
chang
ing
who
we
the
at
tacks
have
brought
out
the
best
in
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
More
than
5
mil

of
the
9/11
Gen

have
worn
Amer
ica's
uni

over
the
past

and
we
've
seen
an
out
pour

of
good
will
to

our

our

and
their

To
gether
they
've
done
ev
ery
thing
we
've
asked
of
them
We
've
ended
the
war
in
Iraq
and
brought
our
troops
home
We
brought
an
end
to
the
Tal

regime
We
've
trained
Afghan
Se
cu

Forces
and
forged
a
part

with
a
new
Afghan
Govern

And
by
the
end
2014
the
tran
si
tion
in
Afghanistan
will
be
com
plete
and
our
war
there
will
be
over
And
fi
nally
in
stead
of
turn

in

with
grief
we
've
hon

the

of

by

reaf

That's

we

as

Be

Eleven

that's
the

--
the

to

There

To

Even

the

9/11
On
this

an

we
still

as

We
're

from

We

And

None

And
it

As

So

let's

And
let's
show
that
the

that

doesn't

The

Hi,

This
La

Day

end
as
we
gather
with

and
friends
we
'll
also
come
to
gether
as
a

to
honor
some
of
our

-
the
work
ing
men
and

of
Amer

across
the
gen
er
a

built
this
coun
try
up
and
helped
make

who
we
are
to

On
Mon

we
'll
cel

that
proud
his

We
'll
pay
trib

to
the
val

work
ing
Amer

em

-
hard
work;
re
spon
si
bil

sac
ri
fice;
look
ing
out
for
one
an

And
we
'll
recom
mit
our
selves
to
their
cause;
to
se
cur
ing
for
them
a
bet
ter
bar
gain
so
that
ev
ery
one
who
works
hard
in
Amer
ica
has
a
chance
to
get
ahead
over
the
past
four
and
a
half
years
we
've
fought
our
way
back
from
the
worst
re
ces
sion
of
our
life
times
And
thanks
to
the
grit
and
re
silience
of
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
we
've
be
gun
to
lay
a
foun
da
tion
for
stronger
more
durable
eco
nomic
growth
But
as
any
work
ing
fam
ily
will
tell
we
're
not
where
we
need
to
be.
For
over
a
decade
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
have
seen
their
wages
and
in
comes
stag
nate
even
as
cor
po
rate
prof
its
soar
and
the
pay
of
a
for
tu
nate
few
ex

For
even
longer
than
that
in
equal
ity
has
steadily
risen;
the
jour
ney
of
up
ward
mo
bil
ity
has
be
come
harder
And
in
too
many
com
mu
ni
ties
across
this
coun
try
the
shadow
of
poverty
con
tin
ues
to
cast
a
pall
over
our
fel
low
cit
i
zens
Rev
ers
ing
that
trend
needs
to
be
Wash
ing
ton's
high
est
pri
or
ity
And
it
sure
is
mine
That's
over
the
past
month
I've
trav
eled
all
across
Amer
ica
lay
ing
out
my
ideas
for
how
we
can
build
on
the
cor
ner
stones
of
what
it
means
to
be
mid
dle
class
A
good
job
that
pays
a
good
wage
A
good
ed
u
ca
tion
A
home
of
your
Health
care
when
you
get
sick
A
se
cure
re
tire
ment
even
if
you
're
not
rich
And
more
chances
for
folks
to
earn
their
way
into
the
mid
dle
class
as
long
as
they
're
will
ing
to
work
for
it.
The
truth
is,
it's
not
go
ing
to
be
easy
to
re
verse
the
forces
that
have
con
spired
-
for
decades
-
against
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
But
if
we
take
a
few
bold
steps
-
and
if
Wash
ing
ton
is
able
to
come
to
gether
with
com
mon
pur
pose
and
com
mon
re
solve
-
we
'll
get
there
Our
econ
omy
will
keep
get
ting
stronger
and
more
Amer
i
cans
will
be
able
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
mid
dle
-
class
So
this
La
bor
while
you
're
out
there
grilling
in
the
back
yard
or
tak
ing
that
fi
nal
trip
for
the
sum

I
hope
you
'll
also
take
a
mo
ment
to
re
flect
on
the
many
con
tri
bu
tions
of
our
work
ing
men
and
women
For
gen
er
a
tions
it
was
the
great
Amer
i
can
mid
dle
class
that
made
our
econ
omy
the
envy
of
the
world
And
as
long
as
I'm
Pres
i
dent
I'm
go
ing
to
keep
fight
ing
to
make
sure
that
hap

again
Thanks

of

in

they
wouldn't

It's
a

that
wouldn't

but
would
force
us
to
re

live
this

It

If

Congress
must
find
com

ground
on
a
plan
that
can
get
sup

from
both

in
the

and
in

And
it's

to
be
a

that
I
can

The

are
not

We
're
in

agree

on
how
much
spend

we
need
to

And
we
agree
on
a

to
tackle

There
are
plenty
of

out

But
there
is
very

We
need
to
reach
a

so
that

Not

That

The

to

in

All
that's

is

they

they

So
last

I
acted

with

In

The

Hi,
ev
ery
body
A
few
days
I
un
veiled
a
new
na
tional
plan
to
con
front
the
grow
ing
threat
of
a
chang
ing
cli
mate
Decades
of
care
fully
re
viewed
sci
ence
tells
us
our
planet
is
chang
ing
in
ways
that
will
have
pro
found
im
pacts
on
the
world
we
leave
our
chil
dren
Al
ready
we
know
that
the
12
warm
est
years
in
recorded
his
tory
have
all
come
in
the
last
15,
and
that
last
year
was
the
warm
est
in
Amer
i
can
his
tory
And
while
we
know
no
sin
gle
weather
event
is
caused
solely
by
cli
mate
change
we
also
know
that
in
a
world
that's
get
ting
warmer
than
it
used
to
be,
all
weather
events
are
af
fected
by
it
--
more
ex
treme
droughts
floods
wild
fires
and
hur
ri
canes
Those
who
al
ready
feel
the
ef
fects
of
a
chang
ing
cli
mate
don't
have
time
to
deny
it.
They
're
busy
deal
ing
with
it
--
the
fire
fight
ers
who
brave
longer
wild
fire
sea
sons;
the
farm
ers
who
see
crops
wilted
one
year
and
washed
away
the
next;
west
ern
fam
i
lies
wor
ried
about
wa
ter
that's
dry
ing
up.
The
costs
of
these
events
can
be
mea
sured
in
lost
lives
and
liveli
hoods
lost
homes
and
busi
nesses
and
hun
dreds
of

lions
of

in

And
Amer

across

are
al

the

of
in
ac
tion
in
higher
food
costs
in
sur
ance
pre
mi
ums
and
the
tab
for
re
build
ing
So
the
ques
tion
is
not
whether
we
need
to
act;
the
ques

is
whether
we
will
have
the
courage
to
act
be

it's

In

af

they'd
al

the

Congress
al

It
doesn't

In

right
our

are
al

at
the

since

by

we

re

our

isn't
even
what
the

The

And
I

But
here's
the

these

Congress

Un

they'd
rather
let

fall

And
here's
what
that
choice
means:
Once

Al

That's
what
this

means
Are

Th

Repub

need

And
I'm

they

Be

The

We
all

the

have
been
dif
fi

for
this
coun

After
the
worst
re
ces

of
our

times
it's
go
ing
to
take
longer
than
any
of
us
would
like
for
the
econ

to
fully
re

But
there
are
plenty
of
steps
we
can
take
to
speed
up
the
re

There
are
things
we
can
do
--
right
now
--
to
help
cre
ate
jobs
and
re
store
some
of
the
fi

se
cu

that
so
many
fam
i

have
lost
the
other
side
isn't
so
op
ti
mistic
They
think
all
we
can
do
is
cut
taxes
--
es
pe
cially
for
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
--
and
go
back
to
let
ting
banks
and
cor
po
ra
tions
write
their
own
rules
again
That's
their
plan
But
I
think
they
're
wrong
We
tried
their
ideas
for
nearly
a
decade
and
it
didn't
work
out
so
well
We
can't
go
back
to
the
same
poli
cies
that
got
us
into
this
mess
We
've
got
to
move
for
ward
We
need
to
build
an
econ
omy
where
hard
work
and
re
spon
si
bil

are
re
warded
--
where
you
can
find
a
good
own
your
own
home
maybe
start
a
busi
ness
and
give
your
kids
the
chance
to
do
even
bet
ter
That's
where
we
need
to
go.
And
I've
been
push
ing
Congress
to
help
us
get
there
by
pass
ing
a
few
com
mon

poli

a

Democrats
and
Repub

have
al

done
some
im

work
to

--
from
pass

tax

for

to
open

up
new

for
Amer
i
can
prod
ucts
to
re
form
ing
our
patent
sys

But
now
we
need
to
do
more
That's
why
we
made
Congress
a
handy
"To

Do"
list
--
just
like
the
kind
I
get
from
Michelle
It's
short
but
each
of
the
ideas
on
this
list
will
help
cre
ate
jobs
and
build
a
stronger
econ
omy
right
First
Congress
should
stop
giv
ing
tax
breaks
to
com
pa
nies
that
ship
jobs
over
seas
and
use
that
money
to
cover
mov
ing
ex
penses
for
com
pa
nies
that
bring
jobs
back
to
Amer
ica
Se

Congress
should
help
the
mil
lions
of
Amer
i
cans
who
have
worked
hard
and
made
their
mort
gage
pay
ments
on
time
re
fi
nance
their
mort
gages
at
lower
rates
and
save
at
least
$3,000
a

Third
Congress
should
help
small
busi
ness
own
ers
by
giv
ing
them
a
tax
break
for
hir
ing
more
work
ers
and
pay
ing
them
higher
wages
Small
busi
nesses
are
the
en
gine
of
eco
nomic
growth
in
this
coun
try
We
shouldn't
be
hold
ing
them
back
--
we
should
be
mak
ing
it
eas
ier
for
them
to
suc

Fourth
if
Congress
fails
to
act
soon
clean
en
ergy
com
pa
nies
will
see
their
taxes
go
up
and
could
be
forced
to
lay

Th
ese
com

nies
are
putting
Amer
i

to
work
and
help
ing
break
our
de
pen
dence
on
for

Congress
should
ex
tend
these
tax

And
fi
nally
Congress
should
help
our
vet
er
ans
re
turn

from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
by
cre
at

a
Veter
ans
Job
Corps
Our
men
and
women
in
uni
form
have
served
this
coun
try
with
honor
Now
it's
our
turn
to
serve
them
So
that's
Congress's
"To
-
Do"
List
But
now
we
need
them
to
start
cross
ing
things
I
need
you
to
call
your
Mem
bers
of
Congress
write
them
an
email
tweet
and
let
them
know
we
can't
af
ford
to
wait
any
longer
to
get
things
done
Tell
them
now
is
the
time
to
take
steps
we
know
will
grow
our
econ

and
cre
ate
jobs
You
're

You

And
your

Let's

Congress
to

the

Let's

for

Thanks

The

Over

And
we

The

Hello
ev
ery
body
Over
the
last
few
weeks
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
dead
lines
we
're
fac
ing
on
jobs
and
taxes
and
in
vest
ments
But
with
so
much
noise
and
so
many
opin
ions
fly
ing
around
it
can
be
easy
to
lose
sight
of
what
this
de
bate
is
re
ally
about
It's
not
about
which
po
lit
i
cal
party
comes
out
on
or
who
wins
or
loses
in
Wash
ing
ton
It's
about
mak
ing
smart
de
ci
sions
that
will
have
a
real
im
pact
on
your
lives
and
the
lives
of
Amer
i
cans
all
across
the
coun
try
Right
mid
dle
-
class
tax
cuts
are
set
to
ex
pire
at
the
end
of
the
year
Time's
run
ning
And
there
are
two
things
that
can
hap
pen
First
if
Congress
does
noth
ing
ev
ery
fam
ily
in
Amer
ica
will
see
their
in
come
taxes
au
to
mat
i
cally
go
up
on
Jan
uary
A
typ
i
cal
mid
dle
-
class
fam
ily
of
four
would
get
a
$2,200
tax
hike
That
would
be
bad
for
fam
i
lies
it'd
be
bad
for
busi
nesses
and
it
would
drag
down
our
en
tire
econ
omy
Congress
can
avoid
all
of
this
by
pass
ing
a
law
that
pre
vents
a
tax
hike
on
the
first
$250,000
of
ev
ery
body's
in
come
That
means
98%
of
Amer
i
cans
and
97%
of
small
busi
nesses
wouldn't
see
their
in
come
taxes
go
up
by
a
sin
gle
dime
Even
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
would
get
a
tax
cut
on
the
first
$250,000
of
their
in
come
And
fam
i
lies
ev
ery
where
would
en
joy
some
peace
of
mind
The
Se
nate
has
al
ready
done
their
part
Now
we
're
just
wait
ing
for
Repub
li
cans
in
the
House
to
do
the
same
thing
But
so
they
've
put
for
ward
an
un
bal
anced
plan
that
ac
tu
ally
low
ers
rates
for
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
If
we
want
to
pro
tect
the
mid
dle
class
then
the
math
just
doesn't
work
We
can
and
should
do
more
than
just
ex
tend
mid
dle
class
tax
cuts
And
I
stand
ready
to
work
with
Repub
li
cans
on
a
plan
that
spurs
eco
nomic
growth
cre
ates
jobs
and
re
duces
our
deficit
--
a
plan
that
gives
both
sides
some
of
what
they
want
I'm
will
ing
to
find
ways
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
health
care
with
out
hurt
ing
se
niors
and
other
Amer
i
cans
who
de
pend
on
it.
And
I'm
will
ing
to
make
more
en
ti
tle
ment
spend
ing
cuts
on
top
of
the
$1
tril
lion
dol
lars
in
spend
ing
cuts
I
signed
into
law
last
year
But
if
we
're
se
ri
ous
about
re
duc
ing
our
deficit
while
still
in
vest
ing
in
things
like
ed
u
ca
tion
and
re
search
that
are
im
por
tant
to
grow
ing
our
econ

--
and
if
we
're
se
ri
ous
about
pro
tect
ing
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i

--
then
we
're
also
go
ing
to
have
to
ask
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
to
pay
higher
tax
rates
That's
one
prin
ci
ple
I
won't
com
pro

on.
After
this
was
a
cen
tral
ques

in

A
clear
ma

of

In

agreed
with

asks
some

but
a
lit

more
from
those
who

It's
the
only

on
a

with
out

even

And
it's
the
only

I'm

Every
one
agrees
we
need
to
bring
down
our

and
strengthen
our

for

The
ques

is
whether

Not

And
we

with
smarter

rules
that
serve
one
pri

pur

--
to
pre

a

like
that
from
ever

And
for
the
past
two
years
too
many
Repub

in

and
an

Re

we
've

why
we

We

that
a

While
that

can

other

may
not

And
with

we
could
've
found
our
selves
with
the

once
again
on

That's
why
it's
so
im

that

on

Th

say
that
if

you

that

we

in

are

up.
Every
Amer

check
will
get

And
that
would
be
the
wrong
thing
to
do
for
our

It
would
hurt

and
it
would

I
be

we
may
be
able
to
reach
an

that
can
pass
both

in

But
if
an

isn't
reached
on

then
I'll
urge
the
Se

to
hold
an
up

If

Hi,
ev
ery
body
In
my
State
of
the
Union
Ad
dress
I
talked
about
pizza
More
specif
i
cally
I
talked
about
a
pizza
chain
in
Min
neapo
lis
-
Punch
Pizza
-
whose
owner
John
So
ranno
made
the
busi
ness
de
ci
sion
to
give
his
em
ploy
ees
a
raise
to
ten
bucks
an
hour
A
cou
ple
weeks
I
got
a
let
ter
from
a
small
busi
ness
owner
who
watched
that
night
Yas
min
Ibrahim
is
an
im
mi
grant
who
owns
her
own
restau
rant
-
Desi
Shack
-
and
plans
to
open
an
other
this
sum
mer
Here's
what
she
wrote
"I
was
moved
by
John
So
ranno's
story
It
got
me
think
ing
about
my
...
full
-
time
em
ploy
ees
and
their
abil
ity
to
sur
vive
on
$8
an

in
New

Ci
ty."
So
a
few
weeks
Yas
min
put
in
place
a
plan
to
lift
wages
for
her
em
ploy
ees
at
both
her
restau
rants
to
at
least
$10
an
hour
by
the
end
of
this
year
But
here's
the
thing
-
Yas
min
isn't
just
rais
ing
her
em
ploy
ees
wages
be
cause
it's
the
right
thing
to
do.
She's
do
ing
it
for
the
same
rea
son
John
So
ranno
It
makes
good
busi
ness
sense
Yas
min
wrote
"It
will
al
low

re

We
be

do

so
makes

sense
while
at
the
same
time
hav

a
pos
i

im

on

Yas
min's
right
That's
two
months
I
is
sued
an
Ex
ec
u
tive
Order
re
quir
ing
work
ers
on
new
fed
eral
con
tracts
to
be
paid
a
fair
wage
of
at
least
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an
hour
But
in
or
der
to
make
a
dif
fer
ence
for
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
Congress
needs
to
do
some
thing
And
Amer
ica
knows
it.
Right
there's
a
bill
that
would
boost
Amer
ica's
min
i
mum
wage
to
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an
hour
That
would
lift
wages
for
nearly
28
mil
lion
Amer
i
cans
across
the
coun
try
28
mil
lion
And
we
're
not
just
talk
ing
about
young
peo
ple
on
their
first
The
av
er
age
min
i
mum
wage
worker
is
35
years
They
work
hard
of
ten
in
phys
i
cally
de
mand
ing
jobs
And
while
not
all
of
us
al
ways
see
eye
to
eye
po
lit
i
cally
one
thing
we
over
whelm
ingly
agree
on
is
that
no
body
who
works
full
-
time
should
ever
have
to
live
in
poverty
That's
why
nearly
three
in
four
Amer
i
cans
sup
port
rais
ing
the
min
i
mum
wage
The
prob
lem
is,
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
don't
sup
port
rais
ing
the
min
i
mum
wage
Some
even
want
to
get
rid
of
it
en
tirely
In
Ok
la
homa
for
ex
am
ple
the
Repub
li
can
gov
er
nor
just
signed
a
law
pro
hibit
ing
cities
from
es
tab
lish
ing
their
own
min
i
mum
wage
That's
why
this
fight
is
so
im
por
tant
That's
why
peo
ple
like
John
and
Yas
min
are
giv
ing
their
work
ers
a
raise
That's
why
sev
eral
states
coun
ties
and
cities
are
go
ing
around
Congress
to
raise
their
work
ers
wages
That's
why
I'll
keep
up
this
fight
Be
cause
we
know
that
our
econ
omy
works
best
when
it
works
for
all
of
us
-
not
just
a
for

nate
We
be
lieve
we
do
bet
ter
when
ev
ery
one
who
works
hard
has
a
chance
to
get
ahead
That's
what
op
por
tu
nity
is
all
about
And
if
you
agree
with
us,
we
could
use
your
help
Repub

have
voted
more
than
50
times
to
un
der
mine
or
re

health
care
for

They
should
vote
at

to

the
min

for

of

ing

i

If
a

rep

tell
him
or

it's
time
to
give
the

a

for
a

and
do
some

to
help

ing

It's

for
"ten

It's
time
to
give
Amer

a

Thanks
and
have
a
great

The
Pres
i
dent:
Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
spent
some
time
trav
el
ing
across
Iowa
talk
ing
with
folks
about
re
build
ing
an
econ
omy
where
if
you
work
hard
you
and
your
fam
ily
can
get
ahead
And
along
the
I
stopped
in
at
Cas
cade
High
School
to
thank
the
teach
ers
there
for
do
ing
such
a
great
job
--
and
wish
them
luck
as
they
head
back
to
the
class
room
for
this
school
year
There's
noth
ing
more
im
por
tant
to
our
coun
try's
fu
ture
than
the
ed
u
ca
tion
we
give
our
kids
And
there's
no
one
more
im
por
tant
to
that
ed
u
ca
tion
than
the
per
son
at
the
front
of
the
class
room
Teach
ers
mat
ter
Most
work
tire
lessly
with
mod
est
some
times
dig
ging
into
their
own
pocket
for
school
sup
plies
--
just
to
make
a
dif
fer
ence
They
give
ev
ery
thing
for
our
kids
--
and
in
re
turn
we
should
in
vest
in
them
But
here's
the
thing:
this
year
sev
eral
thou
sand
fewer
ed
u
ca
tors
will
be
go
ing
back
to
school
Since
2009
we
've
lost
more
than
300,000
ed
u
ca
tion
jobs
in
part
be
cause
of
bud
get
cuts
at
the
state
and
lo
cal
level
Think
about
what
that
means
for
our
coun
try
At
a
time
when
the
rest
of
the
world
is
rac
ing
to
out
-
ed
u
cate
Amer
ica
these
cuts
force
our
kids
into
crowded
class
rooms
can
cel
pro
grams
for
preschool
ers
and
kinder
gart
ners
and
shorten
the
school
week
and
the
school
year
That's
the
op
po
site
of
what
we
should
be
do
ing
as
a
coun
try
States
should
be
mak
ing
ed
u
ca
tion
a
pri
or
ity
in
their
bud
gets
even
in
tough
fis
cal
times
And
Congress
should
be
will
ing
to
help
out
--
be
cause
this
af
fects
all
of
us.
That's
why
part
of
the
jobs
bill
that
I
sent
to
Congress
last
Septem
ber
in
cluded
sup
port
for
states
to
pre
vent
fur
ther
lay
offs
and
to
re
hire
teach
ers
who'd
lost
their
jobs
But
here
we
are
--
a
year
later
with
tens
of
thou
sands
more
ed
u
ca
tors
laid
off
--
and
Congress
still
hasn't
done
any
thing
about
it.
In
fact
the
eco
nomic
plan
that
al
most
ev
ery
Repub
li
can
in
Congress
voted
for
would
make
the
sit
u
a
tion
even
worse
It
would
ac
tu
ally
cut
fund
ing
for
ed
u
ca
tion
--
which
means
fewer
kids
in
Head
Start
fewer
teach
ers
in
our
class
rooms
and
fewer
col
lege
stu
dents
with
ac
cess
to
fi
nan
cial
aid
--
all
to
pay
for
a
mas
sive
new
tax
cut
for
mil
lion
aires
and
bil
lion
aires
That's
back
wards
That's
wrong
That
plan
doesn't
in
vest
in
our
fu
ture;
it
un
der
cuts
our
fu
ture
If
we
want
Amer
ica
to
lead
in
the
21st
cen
tury
noth
ing
is
more
im
por
tant
than
giv
ing
ev

the
best
ed
u
ca
tion
pos
si
ble
--
from
the
day
they
start
preschool
to
the
day
they
start
their
ca
reer
That's
why
we
launched
a
na
tional
com
pe
ti
tion
to
im
prove
our
schools
And
for
less
than
1%
of
what
our

spends
on

u

each
year
we
've
en
cour
aged
al

to
raise
their

dards
--
the
first
time
that's
hap
pened
in
a

That's
why
we
've
in
vested
in

and

ed
u
ca

and
given
states
more
flex

on

And
that's
why
we

Hi,
ev

Yes
ter

we
learned
that
our

cre

an

118,000

in

That
makes
67

And
es

at

more

Repub

in
Congress
voted
to
shut

for
the

time
in

For
tu

there
were
enough

in

to
pass
a

to

Un

Look
that's

It

And
that's
why
I
will
not

like
the
one
Congress
sent

this

Here's
A
few

both
par

agreed
to
put
in
place
harm
ful
au
to
matic
cuts
that
make
no
dis

be
tween
spend
ing
we
don't
need
and
spend
ing
we
do.
Those
cuts
have
ac
tu

kept
our
econ

from
grow

faster
Even
worse
they
're
ac
tu

un

Here's
one
ex

If
we
don't
undo
these

then
next

we
'll
be
fund

That's
not

It's
a
pre

for

And
it
shouldn't

We
should
in

to

or
we
'll
pay
the

to

Congress
should
do
its
stop
kick

the

down

and
pass
a
se

bud
get
rather
than
flirt
with
an

A

is
one
that
keeps

That's

I

As

So,

I

That's
the
equiv

It's

It

It's
a
no

brainer
that
should
have
passed
eas
ily
But
Repub

in
Congress
banded
to
gether
and
kept
this
plan
from
even
com

to

They
banded
to

and
pre

--
in

many
of

from

That's
money
that
could

That's

so
they

But
Repub

The

Hi,
ev
ery
body
Four
years
af
ter
the
worst
eco
nomic
cri

of
our
life
times
we
're
see
ing
signs
that
as
a
na
tion
we
're
mov
ing
for
ward
again
After
los
ing
about
800,000
jobs
a
month
when
I
took
of
fice
our
busi
nesses
have
now
added
5.2
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
past
two
and
a
half
years
And
on
Fri
day
we
learned
that
the
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
is
now
at
its
low
est
level
since
I
took
of
fice
More
Amer
i
cans
are
en
ter
ing
the
work
force
More
Amer
i
cans
are
get

jobs
But
too
many
of
our
friends
and
neigh

are
still
look
ing
for
work
or
strug
gling
to
pay
the
bills
--
many
of
them
since
long
be
fore
this
cri
sis
We
owe
it
to
them
to
keep
mov
ing
for
ward
We
've
come
too
far
to
turn
back
We
've
made
too
much
progress
to
re
turn
to
the
poli
cies
that
got
us
into
this
mess
in
the
first
place
For
ex
am
ple
--
two
years
we
put
in
place
tougher
com
mon
sense
rules
of
the
road
for
Wall
Street
to
make
sure
that
the
kind
of
cri
sis
we
've
been
fight
ing
back
from
never
hap
pens
again
Th
ese
rules
mean
that
big
banks
are
no
longer
go
ing
to
be
able
to
make
risky
bets
with
your
de
posits
And
if
a
big
bank
does
make
a
bad
de
ci
sion
they
pay
for
it
--
not
tax
pay
ers
And
we
also
put
in
place
the
strong
est
con
sumer
pro
tec
tions
in
our
his
tory
to
crack
down
on
the
worst
prac
tices
of
credit
card
com
pa
nies
and
mort
gage
lenders
But
for
some
rea
son
some
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
are
still
wag
ing
an
all
-
out
bat
tle
to

fund
and
dis

these
com

new

Why?
Do
they
think
un
do

rules
that
pro
tect
fam
i
lies
from
the
worst
prac

of
credit
card
com
pa

and
mort

lenders
will
make
the
mid

class
stronger?
Do
they
think
get
ting
rid
of
rules
to
pre
vent
an
other
cri
sis
on
Wall
Street
will
make
Main
Street
any
safer?
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
need
to
stop
try
ing
to
re

fight
the
bat
tles
of
the
past
few
years
and
fi
nally
start
do
ing
some
thing
to
ac
tu
ally
help
the
mid

class
get
ahead
And
here
are
three
things
they
can
do
right
First
Congress
needs
to
step
up
and
guar
an
tee
that
98%
of
Amer
i
cans
and
97%
of
small
busi
ness
own
ers
won't
see
their
taxes
go
up
next
year
This
is
some
thing
that
ev
ery
one
says
they
agree
on.
It
should
have
got
ten
done
months
But
Repub
li

in
Congress
are

in
the
They

of

hostage
un
til
we
pass
tax
cuts
for
the
wealth
i
est
2%
of
Amer
i

Ask
them
how
that
helps
the
mid

class
Se

Congress

I
gave

a

to

It's

But
Repub

Ask

Third

A

Repub

in

plan

Ask
them
why
some
one
who
fights
for
this
coun

abroad
should
have
to
fight
for
a
job
when
they
come
home
In
other
words
ask
them
to
get
back
to
work
and
get
these
things
done
If
we
're
go

to
keep

there's

Every

If

Hello

I'm

this

Wash
ing

Boe

has
been
in
this
com
mu

for
half
a

But
it's
what
they
're
do
ing
here
to

that
has
folks
re

ex
cit

be
cause
at
this
plant
they
're
build

the
plane
of
the

--
the
Dream

It's
an
im
pres
sive
sight
to
be
hon
est
part
of
why
I
came
was
to
see
it
up
close
But
I
also
came
be
cause
this
is
a
great
ex
am
ple
of
how
we
can
bring
jobs
and
man
u
fac
tur
ing
back
to
Amer
ica
You
the
last
few
decades
haven't
been
easy
for
man
u
fac

in
this
coun
try
New
tech
nol
ogy
has
made
busi
nesses
more
ef
fi
cient
and
pro
duc
tive
--
and
that's
good
--
but
it's
also
made
a
lot
of
jobs
ob
so
lete
The
re
sult
has
been
painful
for
a
lot
of
fam
i
lies
and
a
lot
of
com
mu
ni
ties
Fac
to
ries
where
peo
ple
thought
they'd
re
tire
have
left
town
Jobs
that
pro
vided
a
de
cent
liv
ing
have
been
shipped
over
seas
And
the
hard
truth
is
that
a
lot
of
those
jobs
aren't
com
ing
back
But
that
doesn't
mean
we
have
to
set
tle
for
a
lesser
fu
ture
I
don't
ac
cept
that
idea
In
Amer
ica
there's
al
ways
some
thing
we
can
do
to
cre
ate
new
jobs
and
new
man
u
fac
tur
ing
and
new
se
cu
rity
for
the
mid
dle
-
class
In
Amer
ica
we
don't
give
up
--
we
get
up.
Right
that's
ex
actly
what
we
're
do
ing
Over
the
past
23
months
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
3.7
mil
lion
new
jobs
And
man
u
fac
tur
ers
are
hir
ing
for
the
first
time
since
the
1990s
It's
now
get
ting
more
ex
pen
sive
to
do
busi
ness
in
places
like
China
Mean
while
Amer
ica
is
more
pro
duc
tive
than
ever
And
com
pa
nies
like
Boe
ing
are
re
al
iz
ing
that
even
when
we
can't
make
things
cheaper
than
China
we
can
make
things
bet

That's
how
we
're
go
ing
to
com

For
Boe

right
now

Last

To

We
want
to

more
of
this
We
need
to
make
it
as
easy
as
we
can
for
our
com
pa
nies
to
cre
ate
more
jobs
in
Amer
ica
not
over

And
that
starts
with
our
tax
code
No
com
pany
should
get
a
tax
break
for
out
sourc
ing
jobs
In
stead
tax
breaks
should
go
to
man
u
fac

ers
who
set
up
shop
here
at

Big
ger
tax
breaks
should
go
to
high
-
tech
man
u
fac

who
cre

of

And
if
you
re

in
a

you
should
get
help
fi
nanc
ing
that
new

that
new
equip

or
train

for
new

It's
time
to
stop
re
ward
ing
busi
nesses
that
ship
jobs
over
seas
and
start
re
ward
ing
busi
nesses
that
cre
ate
jobs
here
in
Amer
ica
And
Congress
should
send
me
that
kind
of
tax
re
form
right
away
Another
thing
we
're
do
ing
is
to
make
it
eas

for
com

like
Boe
ing
to
sell
their

all
over
the

be

more

more

Two

I
set
a
goal
of
dou

ex

over
five
years
And
we
're
on
track
to
meet
that
goal
--
ahead
of

We
have
a
big
op
por

right
now
to
build
not
only
an

that
will
help

an

Hi,
ev

Every

over

has
been

What
we
've
long
un
der
stood
though
is
that
some
com
mu

have
con
sis
tently
had
the
odds
stacked
against
them
That's
true
of
ru
ral
com

with
chronic
poverty
That's
true
of
some
man

ing
com

that
suf

af
ter
the
plants
they
de
pended
on
closed
their

It's
true
of
some
sub
urbs
and
in
ner
cities
where
jobs
can
be
hard
to
find
and
harder
to
get
to.
That
sense
of
un
fair
ness
and
pow
er
less

has
helped
to
fuel
the
kind
of
un

that
we
've
seen
in

like

there

down

We

since

we

brought

down

about
40

a

And
there
are
pow

of
how
we
can

--
mak

that
are

"Made

This
is

over

We
racked
up
a

of

we
didn't

If
we

We

But
build

it's

it's
an

But
in
a
larger

this
is
a
mo

when
we
've
all

what
the

We
've

Our

has
to

and
op

in

fiercely

And
this

we
re
ceived
very
good
news
on
that
front
We
learned
that
the

ploy
ment
rate
has
fallen
to
its
low
est
level
in
nearly
two
years
as
our
econ

added
an
other
222,000
pri
vate
sec

jobs
last

we
have
a
lot
more
work
to
do,
not
just
for
the
Amer
i
cans
who
still
don't
have
jobs
but
for
the
mil

more
who
still
don't
have
the
right
job
or
all
the
work
they
need
to
live
out
the
Amer
i
can
Dream
But
the
progress
we
're
see
ing
says
some
thing
about
the
de
ter
mi
na

and
in
ge
nu
ity
of
our
peo

and
our
busi

What's
also
help
ing
to
fuel
this
eco

growth
are
the
tax
cuts
that
Democrats
and
Repub

came
to

to

in
De

The
good

is,

That

I'm

Hi,

To

Septem

It's

where

Here's
why
this
mat
ters
More
Amer
i
cans
now
die
ev
ery
year
from
drug
over
doses
than
they
do
in
car
crashes
And
most
of
those
deaths
aren't
due
to
drugs
like
co
caine
or
heroin
-
but
rather
pre
scrip
tion
drugs
In
2013
alone
over
doses
from
pre
scrip
tion
pain
med
i
ca
tions
killed
more
than
16,000
Amer
i
cans
And
most
young
peo
ple
who
be
gin
mis
us
ing
pre
scrip
tion
drugs
don't
buy
them
in
some
dark
al

-
they
get
them
from
the
medicine
cab
i
net
If
that's
not
a
good
enough
rea
son
to
par

in

here's
an

Many

be
long
to
the
same
class
of
drugs
as
heroin
In
fact
four
in
five
heroin
users
started
out
by
mis
us
ing
pre
scrip

drugs
And
over
the
course
of
just
one
year
be
tween
2013
and
2014
we
saw
a
33%
in
crease
in
the
num

of
heroin

All
of
this
takes
a
ter
ri

toll
on

many

in

Hi

One
of
the

One
of

Over

And
to

clean

from

is
ac
tu

cheaper
in
many
com
mu

It's
helped
grow
our

and
cut
our

bon
pol

more
than
any
other
coun

on

That

helped
bring
nearly
200

in

around
the

And
in

ever

In

That's

As

That's

This

to

more

faster
lower

And
while

many

in

And
I

learned
that
our

added
nearly
250,000
new

last

The

fell
to
7.7%

still
too
high

now
lower

That
means
ask

our

three
ques

ev

How
do
we
make
Amer

a
mag
net
for
new

How
do
we
equip
more
of
our
peo

with
the

jobs
re
quire?
And
how
do
we
make
sure
that
your
hard
work
leads
to
a
de
cent
liv

That
has
to
be
our
driv
ing
fo

our
North

And
at
a
time
when
our

are

the

we

That's
why
I've

Se

the

the
so

The

is,
Amer

a

That's
part
of
what

and
frankly
makes
our

some

messy
and
a

pretty

But
ul

mately
what

that
what

As

I'm

I've

some

to
want

And
I
ab

agree
that
the
only
way
we
'll
be
able

af

we
need
is
if
we
cut
the
things
we
don't

live

But
I
refuse
to
cut

Over

I've

I've

How

to

I've

that
this
is
a

break

for

and
I
be
lieve
it.
The

we

over
the

will
have
an
enor

on
the

the

we

Right
we
're
still

The

but
it's
not
grow

fast

Our

have
cre

4.3
mil

new

over
the

27

but
we
're

And
we
're

the

of
the

spike
in

to

in

But
here's
the
thing:
We
have
the
an

to
these
prob

We
have
plenty
of
big
ideas
and
tech
ni

so
lu

from
both
sides
of

That's
not
what's
hold
ing
us
back
What's
hold
ing
us
back
is
a
stale
mate
in
Wash
ing
ton
Last
Septem
ber
I
sent
Congress
a
jobs
bill
full
of
the
kinds
of
bi
par
ti
san
ideas
that
could
put
over
a
mil

Amer

back
to
work
and
help
bol
ster
our
econ

against
out

I
sent
them
a
plan
that
would
've
re
duced
our
deficit
by
$4
tril

in
a

way
that

Since
then
Congress
has
passed
a

of
that

--
like
a

that's
al
low

ing
Amer
i

but
on

of
the

that
would
cre

grow

Repub

Congress
have
not

They'd
rather
wait

in
Novem

Just
this
past
week
one
of
them
said
"Why
not
wait
for
the

That's
a
quote
And
you
can
bet
plenty
of
his
col

are
think
ing
the
same
thing
I
think
that's
wrong
This
isn't
about
who

or
loses
in
Wash

This
is
about
your

and
your

and
your

There
is
no

noth

while

many

are

No
rea

And
right
Congress

And
in

of

they
should
give
small

a
tax
break
for

to

They

so
we
don't
walk

And
in
stead
of
giv

to

Congress
should
take
that

Hi,
ev
ery
body
Just
in
time
for
the
hol
i
day
sea
son
we
now
have
an
other
piece
of
good
news
about
the
pace
of
our
eco
nomic
re
cov
ery
Last
month
our
busi
nesses
cre
ated
314,000
new
jobs
And
that's
not
a
fluke
-
it
keeps
up
the
solid
pace
of
job
cre
ation
we
've
seen
all
year
long
Novem
ber
was
the
tenth
month
in
a
row
we
've
added
more
than
200,000
jobs
So
far
this
year
our
econ
omy
has
cre
ated
2.65
mil
lion
new
jobs
That's
the
most
of
any
year
since
the
1990s
-
even
with
a
full
month
to
go.
All
told
our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
10.9
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
past
57
months
And
that's
the
long
est
streak
of
pri
vate
-
sec
tor
job
cre
ation
on
record
We
also
know
that
the
up
swing
in
job
growth
this
year
has
come
in
in
dus
tries
with
higher
wages
Over
all
wages
are
on
the
rise
And
that's
some
very
wel
come
news
for
mil
lions
of
hard
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
Be
cause
even
though
cor
po

prof

the
stock

have
hit
all
-
time
highs
the
typ
i
cal
fam
ily
isn't
bring
ing
home
more
than
they
did
15
years
And
that
still
has
to
change
And
a
vi
brant
jobs
mar
ket
gives
us
the
op
por
tu
nity
to
keep
up
this
progress
and
be
gin
to
undo
that
decades
-
long
mid

But
first
we
need
the
out
go
ing
Congress
to
pass
a
bud
get
and
keep
our
gov
ern
ment
open
A
Christ
mas
shut
down
is
not
a
good
idea
Then
when
the
new
Congress
con
venes
in
Jan

we
need
to
work
to

to

in

That

Re
cently
there
have
been
signs
that
the
econ
omy
is
pick
ing
up
steam
Last
month
we
saw
the
strong
est
job
growth
in
five
years
and
have
added
more
than
three
-
quar

of
a
mil
lion
pri

in

But
there
are
still
too
many

who

Without
a
doubt
one
of
the
big
gest
bur
dens
over
the
last
few
months
has
been
the
price
of

In
many
places
gas
is
now
more
than
$4
a

mean
ing
that
you
could
be

more

Th

and
while
there

to

there
are
a

we
should
take
that

we

For

The

one
of
the

And
that

The
Pres

This
week
I've
been
trav
el

across
the
coun

--
from
North
Carolina
to
Ge
or
gia
to
here
at
Hyde

in

of

--

I

of

nomic
growth
--
a
ris

Every
we
should
ask
our
selves
three
ques
tions:
How
do
we
bring
good
jobs
to
Amer
i
ca?
How
do
we
equip
peo
ple
with
the
skills
those
jobs
re
quire?
And
how
do
we
make
sure
your
hard
work
leads
to
a
de

liv

I
be
lieve
all
that
starts
by
mak
ing
Amer

and
man
u
fac

ing
After
shed
ding
jobs
for
more
than
10
years
our
man
u
fac
tur
ers
have
added
about
500,000
jobs
over
the
past
three
What
we
need
to
do
now
is
sim
ple
We
need
to
ac
cel
er
ate
that
trend
We
need
to
launch
man
u
fac
tur
ing
hubs
across
the
coun
try
that
will
trans
form
hard
-
hit
re
gions
into
global
cen
ters
of
high
-
tech
jobs
and
man
u
fac

We
need
to
make
our
tax
code
more
com
pet
i

end

for
com
pa
nies
that
ship
jobs
over
seas
and
re
ward
ing
com
pa
nies
that
cre
ate
jobs
here
at
home
And
we
need
to
in
vest
in
the
re
search
and
tech
nol
ogy
that
will
al
low
us
to
har
ness
more
of
our
en

and
put
more
peo
ple
back
to
work
re
pair
ing
our
crum
bling
roads
and
bridges
Th
ese
steps
will
help
our
busi
nesses
ex
pand
and
cre
ate
new
jobs
But
we
also
need
to
pro
vide
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
with
the
skills
and
train
ing
that
they
need
to
fill
those
jobs
Let's
start
in
the
ear
li
est
years
by
of
fer
ing
high
-
qual
ity
pre
-
school
to
ev
ery
child
in
Amer
ica
be
cause
we
know
kids
in
these
pro
grams
do
bet
ter
through
out
their
lives
Let's
re
design
our
high
schools
so
that
our
stu
dents
grad
u
ate
with
the
skills
that
em
ploy
ers
are
look
ing
for
right
And
be
cause
tax
pay
ers
can't
con
tinue
to
sub
si
dize
the
soar
ing
cost
of
higher
ed
u
ca

I've
called
on
Congress
to
take
af
ford

and
value
into
ac
count
when
de
ter
min
ing
which
col
leges
re
ceive
cer

types
of

So
those
are
steps
we
can
take
to
help
bring
good
jobs
to
Amer
ica
and
equip
our
peo
ple
with
the
skills
those
jobs
re
quire
And
that
brings
us
to
the
third
ques
tion
--
how
do
we
make
sure
hard
work
leads
to
a
de
cent
liv
ing?
No
one
in
Amer
ica
should
work
full
-
time
and
raise
their
chil
dren
in
poverty
So
let's
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
so
that
it's
a
wage
you
can
live
on.
And
it's
time
to
har

tal

and
in

Th

steps
will
help
grow
our

and
re
build
a
ris

thriv

mid

And
we
can
do
it
while
shrink
ing
our
deficits
We
don't
have
to
choose
be
tween
the
two
--
we
just
have
to
make
smart
choices
Over
the
last
few
years
both
par
ties
have
worked
to
gether
to
re
duce
the
deficit
by
more
than
$2.5
tril

--
which
puts
us
more
than
half
way
to

the
goal
of
$4

re
duc

that
econ
o

say
we
need

Now
we
need
to

But
I
dis
agree
with
Repub

cans
who
think
we
should
do
that
by
mak

even
big
ger

to
things
like
ed

ca

and
job
train

or
Medi

and
So

Se

That
would
force
our
se

cit
i

and
work
ing
fam
i

to
bear
the
bur
den
of

re
duc

while
the
wealth
i

are
asked
to
do
noth
ing
more
That
won't
work
We
can't
just
cut
our
way
to

per

In

I've
pro
posed
a
bal
anced
ap
proach;
one
that
makes
re
spon
si
ble
re

to
bring
down
the
cost
of

So
we
know
what
we
need
to

All
the
steps
I've

are
com

they
will

strengthen
our

In
the
com

weeks
and
months
our
work
won't
be
easy
and
we
won't
agree
on
ev

thing
But
Amer

only
moves

when
we
do
so
to

That's

And

I

so
they

That's

just
like
this
one
--
the
ris

what
we
can
do
as
a
coun

to
re
duce
our

This

I
re
leased
a
Blueprint
for
a
Se

En

Fu

It's
a
strat
egy
to
re
duce
the

we
im
port

around
the

and
to
make
our
econ

stronger
at

Part
of
this

in

in

our

right
here
in
Amer

In
fact
our
oil
pro
duc

last

reached
its
high
est
level
since
2003
and
we
want
to
en
cour
age
more
safe
re
spon
si

drilling
where
we
But
the
truth
is,
drilling
alone
is
not
a
real
strat
egy
to
re
place
our
de
pen
dence
on
for
eign
And
that's
be
cause
even
though
Amer
ica
uses
25%
of
the
world's
we
cur
rently
have
only
about
2%
of
the
world's
oil
re
serves
Even
if
we
used
ev
ery
last
drop
of
all
the
oil
we
have
it
wouldn't
be
enough
to
meet
our
long
-
term
en
ergy
needs
So,
real
en
ergy
se
cu
rity
can
only
come
if
we
find
ways
to
use
less
oil
--
if
we
in
vest
in
cleaner
fu
els
and
greater
ef
fi
ciency
That's
what
we
've
been
do
ing
since
I
took

For
ex

we

an

the
ma
jor
auto
com
pa

to
raise
the

ef
fi

stan
dards
of
their

and

So
if
you
buy
a
new
the
bet
ter
gas
mileage
is
go
ing
to
save
you
about
$3,000
Al
to
gether
this
will
save
us
about
1.8
bil
lion
bar
rels
of
oil
as
a
coun

So
we
need
to
build
on
that
progress
As
we
make
our
cars
and

more
ef

we
've

In

But
in

That's

And
the

this

We

We

We

en

from

turn

into

which
holds
back
our

It's

Congress
fi

passed
a
set
of
trade

that
would
help
dis

look

and
that
would
al

our

South

we

to
all
those
con

work

who
lost
their

when

We
could
put

by

Those
are
a

that

and
these
are
ideas
that
have
been
sup
ported
by
both

Repub

in

So
I'm
go

to
keep
call

on
both

in

to
put

their

After

Both

sure
our
schools
were
ac
tu

im
prov

or
whether
we
were
giv
ing
teach

the
tools
they
need
or
whether
our
tax
payer
dol

were
be
ing
used
ef
fec
tively
And
our
kids
too
of
ten
paid
the
price
over
the
past
few
years
we
've
seen
signs
that
our
el
e
men
tary
and
sec
ondary
school
stu

are
do
ing
bet
ter
Last
year
our
younger
stu
dents
earned
the
high
est
math
and
read
ing
scores
on
record
Last
week
we
learned
that
our
high
school
grad
u
a
tion
rate
hit
a
new
all
-
time
high
This
is
progress
But
in
a
21st
cen
tury
econ
omy
our
kids
will
only
do
bet
ter
than
we
did
if
we
ed
u
cate
them
bet
ter
than
we
were
ed
u

So
we
have
to
do
more
to
make
sure
they
grad
u
ate
from
school
fully
pre
pared
for
col
lege
and
a
ca
reer
This
year
I
want
to
work
with
both
par
ties
in
Congress
to
re
place
No
Child
Left
Be
hind
with
a
smarter
law
that
ad
dresses
the
overuse
of
stan
dard
ized
tests
makes
a
real
in
vest
ment
in
preschool
and
gives
ev
ery
kid
a
fair
shot
in
the
new
econ
omy
it's
pretty
com
mon
sense
that
an
ed
u
ca
tion
bill
should
ac
tu
ally
im
prove
ed
u
ca
tion
But
as
we
speak
there's
a
Repub
li
can
bill
in
Congress
that
would
frankly
do
the
op
po
site
At
a
time
when
we
should
in
vest
more
in
our
kids
their
plan
would
lock
in
cuts
to
schools
for
the
rest
of
this
decade
We'd
end
up
ac
tu
ally
in
vest
less
in
our
kids
in
2021
than
we
did
in
2012
At
a
time
when
we
should
give
our
teach
ers
all
the
re
sources
they
need
their
plan
could
let
states
and
cities
shuf
fle
ed
u
ca
tion
dol
lars
into
things
like
sports
sta
di
ums
or
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthy
At
a
time
when
we
have
to
give
ev
ery
child
ev
ery
where
a
fair
shot
-
this
Congress
would
ac
tu
ally
al
low
states
to
make
even
deeper
cuts
into
school
dis
tricts
that
need
the
most
sup
port
send
even
more
money
to
some
of
the
wealth
i
est
school
dis
tricts
in
Amer
ica
and
turn
back
the
clock
to
a
time
when
too
many
stu
dents
were
left
be
hind
in
fail
ing
schools
Deny
ing
a
qual
ity
ed
u
ca
tion
to
the
chil
dren
of
work
ing
fam
i
lies
is
as
wrong
as
deny
ing
health
care
or
child
care
to
work
ing
fam
i
lies
We
are
bet
ter
than
this
I
have
a
dif
fer
ent
vi
sion
for
the
mid
dle
class
In
to
day's
world
we
have
to
equip
all
our
kids
with
an
ed
u
ca
tion
that
pre
pares
them
for
suc
cess
re
gard
less
of
what
they
look
like
or
how
much
their
par
ents
make
or
the
zip
code
they
live
in.
And
that
means
try
ing
new
things
in
vest
ing
in
what's
work
ing
and
fix
ing
what's
That
means
cut
ting
test
ing
down
to
the
bare
min
i
mum
re
quired
to
make
sure
par
ents
and
teach
ers
know
how
our
kids
and
schools
are
do
ing
from
year
to
year
and
rel
a

to
schools
statewide
That
means
giv
ing
the
teach
ers
and
prin
ci
pals
who
do
the
hard
work
ev
ery
day
the
re
sources
they
need
to
spend
less
time
teach
ing
to
a
test
and
more
time
teach
ing
our
kids
the
skills
they
need
Some
of
these
changes
are
hard
They
'll
re
quire
all
of
us
to
de
mand
more
of
our
schools
and
more
of
our
kids
mak
ing
sure
they
put
down
the
video
games
and
iPhones
and
pick
up
the

They
'll
re

to

that
Wash

ton
treat
ed

as
the

of

-
some
thing
a
town
with
a
short
at
ten

span
doesn't
al
ways
do
very
well
But
I'm
con
fi

we
can
do
this
When
it
comes
to
ed
u

we
are
not
a

of

we

Noth

will

as

in

more
than
how

And
we
shouldn't

So,

Hi
ev

As
I
said
in
my
State
of
the
Union
ad
dress
we
live
in
a
time
of
ex
tra
or
di
nary
change
-
change
that's
af
fect
ing
the
way
we
live
and
the
way
we
work
New
tech
nol
ogy
re
places
any
job
where
work
can
be
au
to
mated
Work
ers
need
more
skills
to
get
ahead
Th
ese
changes
aren't
and
they
're
only
go
ing
to
ac
cel
er
ate
So
the
ques
tion
we
have
to
ask
our
selves
is,
"How
can
we
make
sure
ev
ery
one
has
a
fair
shot
at
suc
cess
in
this
new
econ
o
my?"
The
an
swer
to
that
ques
tion
starts
with
ed
u
ca
tion
That's
why
my
Ad
min
is
tra
tion
has
en
cour
aged
states
to
raise
stan
dards
We
've
cut
the
dig
i
tal
di
vide
in
our
class
rooms
in

We
've
worked
with
Congress
to
pass
a
bi
par
ti
san
bill
to
set
the
ex
pec
ta
tion
that
ev
ery
stu
dent
should
grad
u
ate
from
high
school
ready
for
col
lege
and
a
good
And
thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
stu
dents
teach
ers
and
par
ents
across
the
coun
try
our
high
school
grad
u
a
tion
rate
is
at
an
all
-
time
high
Now
we
have
to
make
sure
all
our
kids
are
equipped
for
the
jobs
of
the
fu
ture
-
which
means
not
just
be
ing
able
to
work
with
com
put
ers
but
de
vel
op
ing
the
an
a
lyt
i
cal
and
cod

skills
to
power
our
in
no
va

econ
omy
To
day's
auto
me
chan
ics
aren't
just
slid
ing
un
der
cars
to
change
the
oil;
they
're
work
ing
on
ma
chines
that
run
on
as
many
as
100
mil
lion
lines
of
code
That's
100
times
more
than
the
Space
Shut
tle
Nurses
are
an
a
lyz
ing

and
man
ag
ing
elec

Ma
chin

are
writ

com
puter
pro

And
work
ers
of
all
kinds
need
to
be
able
to
fig
ure
out
how
to
break
a
big
prob
lem
into
smaller
pieces
and
iden
tify
the
right
steps
to
solve
it.
In
the
new
econ
omy
com
puter
sci
ence
isn't
an
op
tional
skill
-
it's
a
ba
sic
skill
right
along
with
the
three
"Rs."
Nine
out
of
ten
par

want
it
taught
at
their
chil
dren's
schools
Yet
right
only
about
a

of

Twenty
-
two

don't

So
I've
got
a
plan
to
help
make

all
our

It's

it

just

-
giv

an

at
learn

the

they
'll

in

First
I'm
ask
ing
Congress
to

over
the
next
three

so
that

And

I'll

That's

To

the

This
is
also
a

that

that

Even

and

And
in
a
larger
sense
that's
em

of
what
Amer

have
al

done
We
've
come

and

what's

That's

Con

We

but

we

Against

who

who

None

None

In

the

For

our
present
and
our
fu
ture
On
Thurs
day
I
out
lined
the
fu
ture
of
our
fight
against
ter
ror
ism
--
the
threats
we
face
and
the
way
in
which
we
will
meet
them
On
Fri
day
I
went
to
An
napo
lis
to
cel
e
brate
the
ex
tra
or
di
nary
young
men
and
women
of
the
United
States
Naval
Academy's
Class
of
2013
--
the
sailors
and
Marines
who
will
not
only
lead
that
fight
but
who
will
lead
our
coun
try
for
decades
to
come
And
on
Mon
day
we
cel
e
brate
Me
mo
rial
Unof
fi
cially
it's
the
start
of
sum
mer
--
a
chance
for
us
to
spend
some
time
with
fam
ily
and
friends
at
bar
be
cues
or
the
beach
get
ting
a
lit
tle
fun
and
re
lax
ation
in
be
fore
head
ing
back
to
work
It's
also
a
day
on
which
we
set
aside
some
time
on
our
own
or
with
our
fam
i
lies
to
honor
and
re
mem
ber
all
the
men
and
women
who
have
given
their
lives
in
ser
vice
to
this
coun
try
we
love
They
are
he
roes
each
and
ev
ery
They
gave
Amer
ica
the
most
pre
cious
thing
they
had
--
"the
last
full
mea
sure
of
de
vo
tion."
And
be
cause
they
we
are
who
we
are
to
day
--
a
free
and
pros
per
ous
na
tion
the
great
est
in
the
world
At
a
time
when
only
about
1%
of
the
Amer

can
peo
ple
bear
the
bur
den
of
our
de

the
ser
vice
and
sac

of
our
men
and

in
uni

isn't
al

read
ily
ap

That's
partly
be
cause
our
sol
diers
sailors
air
men
Marines
and
coast
guards
men
are
so
skilled
at
what
they
do.
It's
also
be
cause
those
who
serve
tend
to
do
so
qui
etly
They
don't
seek
the
lime
light
They
don't
serve
for
our
ad
mi
ra
tion
or
even
our
grat
i
tude
They
risk
their
lives
and
many
give
their
lives
for
some
thing
larger
than
them
selves
or
any
of
us:
the
ideals
of
lib
erty
and
jus
tice
that
make
Amer
ica
a
bea
con
of
hope
for
the
world
That's
been
true
through
out
our
his

--
from
our

li
est
days
when
a
tiny
band
of

to
our
9/11
Gen
er
a

which

and
sac
ri

to

Every
time
a
threat
has
risen
Amer
i
cans
have
risen
to
meet
it.
And
be
cause
of
that
courage
--
that
will
ing
ness
to
fight
and
even
die
--
Amer

That
is
the
pur

of
Me

To

with

the
count
less
men
and

who
gave

so
we
could
know

and
live
in

And
we
must
do

We

We

We

--
for

And

The

this

That's

It's

Hi,

But
our

should
ex

be
yond
what
our

have
done
for

in
the

It
should
re
mind
us
of
our

si
bil

to
serve
them
as
well
as
they
have
served
us.
It
should
com

to

In

We
've
now
slashed
the

by
nearly
90
per

from
its
peak
We
're

the

of

and
we
've

The

is
down
to
3.9

-
even
lower
than
the

Of
course
we
're
not

We

still
got
more

But
this
isn't

We
all
have
a

Less

So
it's

That's

Three

Without

Flo
grabbed

When

went
Flo
was

But

Hello

Years
of

over

and
a

for
a

to
the
brink
of
col

We
didn't
have
many
good

On
the
one
hand
we
could
have
con

the

of

to

with
no

On

we
could
have
walked

and
al

to
go

of

--
which
could
have
wiped
out
one

Amer

I
re
fused
to
let

So
we
came
up
with
a

We
said
to
the

if

we
'll
make

One
called

"the

They
said
we
should
just
walk
away
and
let
these
jobs

To

the
men

in
this

Since

the

For

What's

40%

That's
real
progress
There's
no
doubt
that
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
and
a
lot
of
work
to

be

But
what's
im

is
that
we
're

be

to

some
of
the
tough

And
if

if

what
the

none

Still
even

since

As

That's
what
we

to

This

To

Chrysler

And
this

we
reached

to
sell

And
that

soon
Chrysler

Most
im

all

tomak

are
now
adding
shifts
and
cre
at

jobs
at
the
strong

since
the
1990s
Chrysler
has
added
a
sec

shift
at
the
Jef
fer

North

in
Detroit
that
I
vis
ited
last

GM
is
adding
a
third

at
its
Ham

for
the

And
GM
plans
to
hire
back
all
of
the
work
ers
they
had
laid

dur

That's

when
you

When

But
that

I

Three

But

It

But
this

Last

in

But
for
many
of

the

don't

when
they

To

more

That's

We

to
leave
their

and
their

and
risk
their

to

The
last
thing
they

have
to

is
fight
for
a

when
they
get

To

On

af

swarmed
the
streets
of
Lon

and
Paris
and
Moscow
and
the

of

There

But
for
a

re

in
the

of

Gen

"The

he

By
the

the

fell
silent
in
Europe
some
40
mil
lion
peo

on
the

had
lost
their

To

we
pay
trib

They

and
the

of

They
risked
their
lives
and
gave
their
lives
so
that
we,
the
peo

the

could
live
free
They
were
women
who
stepped
up
in
un

bers
man
ning
the

and
-
like
my
grand

-
build

This
was
the

that
lit

saved
the
world
-
that
ended
the
war
and
laid
a
foun

This
was
the
gen

a

that
traded
in
their
uni

for
a

so
they

their
sweet

buy

This

I

Mil

And

For

Com

All

In

And

If

Over

roughly

the

In

If

we

That's
af

Well

We

And
out

does

I
want

there's

thing
even

im

at

I've

a

for

And
the

is
no

It's
wrong
for
any

to

that
the
only
op

for

I
don't
ac
cept
that
None
of
us
should
That's
why
we
launched
a
plan
a
cou
ple
years
ago
that's
helped
nearly
one
mil
lion
re
spon
si
ble
home
own

re
fi
nance
their
mort

and
save
an
av
er
age
of
$300
on
their
pay
ments
each
month
I'll
be
the
first
to
ad
mit
it
didn't
help
as
many
folks
as
we'd
hoped
But
that
doesn't
mean
we
shouldn't
keep
try
ing
That's
why
I'm
send
ing
Congress
a
plan
that
will
give
ev
ery
re
spon
si
ble
home
owner
the
chance
to
save
about
$3,000
a
year
on
their
mort

by
re
fi
nanc
ing
at
his
tor
i
cally
low

No
more
red

No
more
end
less
forms
And
a
small
fee
on
the
largest
fi
nan
cial
in
sti
tu
tions
will
make
sure
it
doesn't
add
a
dime
to
the
deficit
I
want
to
be
clear:
this
plan
will
not
help
folks
who
bought
a
house
they
couldn't
af
ford
and
then
walked
away
from
it.
It
won't
help
folks
who
bought
mul
ti
ple
houses
just
to
turn
around
and
sell
them
in
spec
u
la
tion
What
this
plan
will
do
is
help
mil
lions
of
re
spon
si
ble
home
own
ers
who
make
their
pay

ev

but
un

couldn't

be
cause
their
home
val

kept
drop

or
they
got
wrapped
up
in
too
much
red

Here's
the
catch
In
or
der
to
lower

for
mil
lions
of
Amer
i

we
need
Congress

They
're
the
ones
who
have
to
pass
this
plan
And
as
any
one
who
has
fol
lowed
the
news
in
the
last
six
months
can
tell
get

Congress
to

any

these

is
not
an
easy
That's
why
I'm
go
ing
to
keep
up
the
pres

on
Congress
to
do
the
right
thing
But
I
also
need
your
help
I
need
your

I
need

The
truth
is,
it
will

It
will
take

there
are

we

what
I

4.3

but
as
we
learned
in
this

re

we
're
not

And
just
like
last

at

our

faces
some
se

ous
head

Gas

are
start

to
come
down
again
but
when
they
spiked
over
the
last
few
months
it
hit
peo

wal

pretty
hard
The

in
Europe's

all

makes

But
from

we
first
took
ac

to

we
knew
the
road
to

wouldn't

We
knew
it
would
take

that
there
would
be

But
we
also

if

who

it
takes
to

and
grow
this

Be
cause
while
we
can't
fully
con

ev

thing
that
hap

in
other
parts
of
the
world
there
are
plenty
of
things
we
can

at

There
are
plenty
of
steps
we
can
take
right
now
to
con
tinue
to
cre
ate
jobs
and
grow
this
econ
omy
I
sent
Congress
a
jobs
bill
last
Septem
ber
full
of
the
kinds
of
bi
par
ti
san
ideas
that
would
have
put
our
fel
low
Amer
i
cans
back
to
work
and
helped
re
in
force
our
econ
omy
against
those
out
side
shocks
I
sent
them
a
plan
that
would
have
re
duced
the
deficit
by
$4
tril
lion
in
a
way
that's
bal
anced
--
that
pays
for
the
job
-
cre
at
ing
in
vest
ments
we
need
by

un

sary
spend
ing
and
ask
ing
the

i
est
Amer
i
cans
to
pay
a
lit
tle
more
in
taxes
Since
then
Congress
has
only
passed
a
few
parts
of
that
jobs
bill
like
a
tax
cut
that's
al
low
ing
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
to
keep
more
of
your
pay
check
ev
ery

And
that's
im
por
tant
But
Congress
hasn't
acted
on
enough
of
the
other
ideas
in
that
bill
that
would
make
a
dif
fer
ence
and
help
cre
ate
jobs
right
There's
no
ex
cuse
for
that
Not
when
so
many
peo
ple
are
look
ing
for
work
Not
when
so
many
peo
ple
are
still
strug
gling
to
pay
the
bills
So
my
mes
sage
to
Congress
is,
let's
get
to
work
Right
Congress
should
pass
a
bill
to
help
states
pre
vent
more
lay
offs
so
we
can
put
thou
sands
of
teach
ers
and
fire
fight
ers
and
po
lice
of
fi
cers
back
on
the
Congress
should
have
passed
a
bill
a
long
time
ago
to
put
thou
sands
of
con
struc
tion
work
ers
back
on
the
job
re
build
ing
our
roads
and
our
bridges
and
our
run
ways
In
stead
of
just
talk
ing
a
good
game
about
job
cre
ators
Congress
should
give
small
busi
ness
own
ers
a
tax
break
for
hir
ing
more
work
ers
and
pay
ing
them
higher
wages
Let's
get
all
that
done
Right
Congress
should
give
ev
ery
re
spon
si
ble
home
owner
the
op
por
tu
nity
to
save
an
av
er
age
of
$3,000
a
year
by
re
fi
nanc
ing
their
mort
gage
Next
week
there's
a
vote
in
Congress
on
a
bill
that
would
give
work
ing
women
the
tools
they
need
to
de
mand
equal
pay
for
equal
work
En
sur
ing
pay
check
fair
ness
for
women
should
be
a
no
-
brainer
And
they
need
to
pass
that
bill
Right
Congress
also
needs
to
ex
tend
tax
cred
its
for
clean
en
ergy
man
u
fac
tur
ers
that
are
set
to
ex
pire
at
the
end
of
the
year
--
so
that
we
don't
walk
away
from
40,000
good
jobs
that
are
be
ing
cre
ated
And
it's
long
past
time
for
Congress
to
end
the
tax
breaks
for
com
pa
nies
that
ship
jobs
over
seas
and
use
that
money
to
cover
mov
ing
ex
penses
for
com
pa
nies
that
are
bring
ing
jobs
back
to
Amer
ica
It's
not

on

But
we

And

It

So

But

There

of

i

who
are

with
their

even
at
a

of

I
know
there
are
some
who
think
that
the
only
op

for
home

is
to
just
stand
by
and
hope
that
the

has

I
don't
agree
with
that
That's
why
my

teamed

from

--
banks
that
were
bailed

That's
not

good
for

it's
also

they

And

Back

The

i

One
of
the

tal
chal

of
our

is
build

an

where
ev

one
gets
a
fair
shot
ev
ery
body
does
their
fair
share
and
ev
ery
body
plays
by
the
same
set
of
rules
And
as
many
Amer
i
cans
rush
to
file
their
taxes
this
week
end
it's
worth
point
ing
out
that
we
've
got
a
tax
sys

that
doesn't
al

hold
the
prin

of
ev

This
is
not
just
about
fair

This
is
also
about
growth
It's
about
be
ing
able
to
make
the
in
vest
ments
we
need
to
strengthen
our
econ
omy
and
cre
ate
jobs
And
it's
about
whether
we
as
a
coun
try
are
will
ing
to
pay
for
those
in
vest
ments
In
a
per
fect
world
of
course
none
of
us
would
have
to
pay
any
taxes
We'd
have
no
deficits
to
pay
down
And
we'd
have
all
the
re
sources
we
needed
to
in
vest
in
things
like
schools
and
roads
and
a
strong
mil
i

and
new

of

in

that

this

Mem

are

to

a
chance
to
set

right
They
get
to
vote
on
what
we
call
the
Buf

Rule
It's
sim
ple:
If
you
make
more
than
$1
mil
lion
ev
ery
year
you
should
pay
at
least
the
same
per
cent
age
of
your

in
taxes
as
mid
dle

class
fam
i

do.
On
the
other
hand
if
you
make
less
than
$250,000
a
year
--
like
98%
of
Amer
i
can
fam
i
lies
do
--
your
taxes
shouldn't
go
up.
That's
all
there
is
to
it.
It's
pretty
sen
si
ble
Most
Amer

One

So

We
just
need
some
Repub

can
politi

to
get
on

with
where
the
coun

is.
I
know
they
'll
say
that
this
is
all
about
want

to

They
prob
a

I've

I've
cut

for

17

But
the
thing
is,
for
most
Amer
i
cans
like
me,
tax
rates
are
near
their
low
est
point
in
50
years
In
2001
and
2003
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
re
ceived
two
huge
new
tax
cuts
We
were
told
these
tax
cuts
would
lead
to
faster
job
growth
In

we
got
the
slow

job
growth
in

the

Amer

were

1990s
we
were
warned
that
it
would
kill

In

fol

So
we
've
tried

down
ex

It

And
mid

have
seen
too

eroded
over

for

they

We

re

just

So
I

The

Well

97%

just

I

So
the
only

I

With
the

we

I
don't

But
even
if

agree
on

we
all
agree

So
let's

The

Hi,
ev

body
On
Fri
day
I
had
a
dis
cus
sion
with
work
ing
women
in
Rhode
Is
land
about
the
eco
nomic
chal
lenges
they
face
in
their
own
lives
--
chal
lenges
shared
by
many
of
Thanks
to
the
work
we
've
all
put
in,
our
econ
omy
has
come
a
long
way
these
past
six
years
Over
the
past
55
months
our
busi
nesses
have
added
10.3
mil
lion
new
jobs
For
the
first
time
in
six
years
the
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
is
be
low
6
per
cent
And
on
Thurs
day
we
learned
that
over
the
past
six
months
our
econ
omy
has
grown
at
its
fastest
pace
since
2003
But
the
gains
of
a
grow
ing
econ
omy
aren't
yet
felt
by
ev
ery
one
So
we
've
got
to
har
ness
this
mo
men
tum
and
make
the
right
choices
so
that
ev
ery
one
who
works
hard
can
get
ahead
In
re
cent
weeks
I've
talked
about
these
choices
from
rais
ing
the
min
i
mum
wage
to
cre
at
ing
new
jobs
in
con
struc
tion
and
man
u
fac
tur
ing
To
day
I
want
to
fo
cus
on
what
I
dis
cussed
with
those
women
--
the
choices
we
need
to
make
to
help
more
women
get
ahead
in
to
day's
econ
omy
Right
women
make
up
al
most
half
of
our
work
ers
More
women
are
their
fam
ily's
main
bread
win
ner
than
ever
be
fore
So
the
sim
ple
truth
is,
when
women
suc
ceed
Amer
ica
suc
ceeds
And
we
should
be
choos
ing
poli
cies
that
ben
e
fit
women
--
be
cause
that
ben
e
fits
all
of
us.
Women
de
serve
fair
Even
though
it's
2014
there
are
women
still
earn
ing
less
than
men
for
do
ing
the
same
work
We
don't
have
sec
ond
-
class
cit
i
zens
in
this
coun
try
--
we
shouldn't
in
the
work
place
ei
ther
So
let's
make
sure
women
earn
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
have
a
fair
shot
at
suc
cess
Women
de
serve
to
be
able
to
take
time
off
to
care
for
a
new
baby
an
ail
ing
par
ent
or
take
a
sick
day
for
them
selves
with
out
run
ning
into
hard
ship
So
let's
make
sure
all
Amer
i
cans
have
ac
cess
to
paid
fam
ily
leave
Preg
nant
work
ers
de
serve
to
be
treated
fairly
Even
to
day
women
can
be
fired
for
tak
ing
too
many
bath
room
breaks
or
forced
on
un
paid
leave
just
for
be
ing
preg
nant
That's
wrong
--
and
we
have
to
choose
poli
cies
that
en
sure
preg
nant
work
ers
are
treated
with
dig
nity
and
re
spect
New
par
ents
de

able

There's
noth
ing
like
the
peace
of
mind
that
comes
with
know
ing
that
your
kids
are
safe
while
you
're
at
work
And
the
ben
e
fits
that
chil
dren
get
out
of
early
en
rich
ment
can
pay
off
for
a
life
time
But
in
many
states
send
ing
your
kid
to
day
care
costs
more
than
send
ing
them
to
a
pub
lic
uni
ver
sity
So
let's
start
de
mand
ing
Pre-K
for
our
kids
And
when
most
low

work
ers
are
women
but
Congress
hasn't
passed
a
min
i
mum
wage
in

in
seven
years
it's
long
past
time
that
women
de
serve
a

About
28

work

would
ben
e
fit
from
an
in
crease
in
the
min
i

wage
to
ten
dol

and
ten

an

And
more
than
half
of
those
work
ers
are
women
The
lo
cal
busi
nesses
where
these
work
ers
spend
their
money
would
ben
e
fit
So
let's
do
this
--
let's
give
Amer

a
raise
All
of
these
poli
cies
are
com

All
of
them
are
within
our
reach
We
've
just
got
to
speak
up
and
choose
them
Be
cause
they
'll
build
a

Amer

for
all

But
even
as

For
this

not

also
the

The

I've

That's

Michelle

I
launched
a
new
ini

on
a
topic
that's
close
to
both
our
hearts:
girls
ed
u

It's
called
"Let
Girls
Learn."
And
its
goal
is
to
help
more
girls
around
the
world
go
to
school
and
stay
in
school
Right
62
mil

who
should

large

stand
in
the
way
of

who
want
to

Maybe
their

can't
af
ford
the
school
fees
Maybe
the
risk
of
be
ing
hurt
or
kid
napped
or
even
killed
by
men
who
will
do
any
thing
to
stop
girls
from
learn
ing
is
just
too
great
Or
maybe
they
aren't
in
school
be
cause
they
're
ex
pected
to
get
mar
ried
and
be
come
moth
ers
while
they
're
still
teenagers
--
or
even
ear

In
too
many
parts
of
the
world
girls
are
still
val
ued
more
for
their
bod
ies
than
for
their
minds
That's
just
plain
wrong
And
we
all
have
to
do
more
to
stop
it.
That's
the
idea
be
hind
"Let
Girls
Learn."
We
're
mak

it
clear
to
any

Good

Over

It's

there's

way
that
lets
us
af
ford

in
the
things
we
need

The
truth
is,
there's
a
lot
we
can
agree
on,
but
one
thing
we
have
to
agree
on
is
that
there's
no
good
rea

any

should
keep

through

I

And
it

Seven

As

But
be
neath
the

we
also
felt
a

that
these

that
to

we
must

From

Over

Our

Our

Our

Thanks
to

freer

Now
we

Will

Or

To

And

This

It's

we

to

out

for

an

that

It's

--
and

In

of

that

we
want
to
give

who

right

in

Al

We

I

So
we

that

And

Our

is
also
aimed

That's
why
we
've
cut

for
95%

That's
why
we

And
that's

This

I
can't
tell
you
that
this
plan
will
bring
back
all
the
jobs
we
've
lost
and
re
store
our
econ

to
full
strength
overnight
The
truth
is,
it
took
nearly
a
decade
of
failed
eco
nomic
poli

to
cre
ate
this
mess
and
it
will
take
years
to
fully
re

the

But
I'm
con
fi
dent
that
we
are
fi
nally

in
the
right
di
rec

We
are
mov

for

And
what
we
can't
af
ford
right
now
is
to
go
back
to
the
same
ideas
that
cre
ated
this
mess
in
the
first
place
Un
for
tu
nately
those
are
the
ideas
we
keep
hear
ing
from
our
friends
in
the
other
party
This
week
the
Repub
li
can
leader
in
the
House
of
Rep
re
sen
ta

of
fered
his
plan
to
cre
ate
jobs
It's
a
plan
that's
sur
pris
ingly
short
and
sadly
fa
mil
iar
First
he
would
re
peal
health
in
sur
ance
re
form
which
would
take
away
tax
cred
its
from
mil
lions
of
small
busi
ness
own
ers
and
take
us
back
to
the
days
when
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
had
free
rein
to
drop
cov
er
age
and
jack
up
pre
mi
ums
Se
cond
he
would
say
no
to
new
in
vest
ments
in
clean
en
ergy
af
ter
his
party
al
ready
voted
against
the
clean
en

tax
cred
its
and
loans
that
are
cre
at
ing
thou
sands
of
new
jobs
and
hun
dreds
of
new
busi
nesses
And
third
even
though
his
party
voted
against
tax
cuts
for
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
he
would
per
ma
nently
keep
in
place
the
tax
cuts
for
the
very
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
--
the
same
tax
cuts
that
have
added
hun
dreds
of
bil
lions
to
our
debt
Th
ese
aren't
new
ideas
They
're
the
same
poli
cies
that
led
us
into
this
re
ces
sion
They
won't
cre
ate
jobs;
they
will
kill
them
They
won't
re
duce
our
deficit;
they
will
add
$1
tril
lion
to
our
deficit
They
will
take
us
back
ward
at
a
time
when
we
need
to
keep
Amer
ica
mov
ing
for
ward
I
know
times
are
tough
I
know
that
the
progress
we
've
made
isn't
good
enough
for
the
mil
lions
of
Amer
i
cans
who
are
still
out
of
work
or
strug
gling
to
pay
the
bills
But
I
also
know
the
char
ac
ter
of
this
na

I
know
that
in
times
of
great
chal
lenge
and
dif
fi
culty
we
don't
fear
the
fu
ture
--
we
shape
the
fu

We
har
ness
the
skills
and
in

nu

of
the
most
dy

coun

on
Earth
to
reach
a

We
do
it
with
op
ti
mism
and
we
do
it
with
con
fi

That's
the
spirit
we
need
right
and
that's
the
fu
ture
I
know
we
can
build
to
gether
Thanks
The

Each

Without

We

about

so.
This
is

I'm

So
to

I
want
to
spend
a
few
min
utes
de
bunk
ing
some
of
the
more
out
ra
geous
myths
cir
cu
lat
ing
on
the
in
ter
net
on
ca
ble
TV,
and
re
peated
at
some
town
halls
across
this
coun
try
Let's
start
with
the
false
claim
that
il
le
gal
im
mi
grants
will
get
health
in
sur
ance
un
der
re
form
That's
not
true
Il
le
gal
im
mi
grants
would
not
be
cov
ered
That
idea
has
never
even
been
on
the
ta
ble
Some
are
also
say
ing
that
cov
er
age
for
abor
tions
would
be
man
dated
un
der
re
form
Also
false
When
it
comes
to
the
cur
rent
ban
on
us
ing
tax
dol
lars
for
abor
tions
noth
ing
will
change
un
der
re
form
And
as
ev
ery
cred
i
ble
per
son
who
has
looked
into
it
has
said
there
are
no
so
-
called
"death
pan

--
an
of
fen
sive
no
tion
to
me
and
to
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
Th
ese
are
phony
claims
meant
to
di
vide
us.
And
we
've
all
heard
the
charge
that
re
form
will
some
how
bring
about
a
gov
ern
ment
takeover
of
health
care
I
know
that
sounds
scary
to
many
folks
It
sounds
scary
to
me,
But
here's
the
thing:
it's
not
true
I
no
sooner
want
gov
ern
ment
to
get
be
tween
you
and
your
doc
tor
than
I
want
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
to
make
ar
bi
trary
de
ci
sions
about
what
med
i
cal
care
is
best
for
as
they
do
to
day
As
I've
said
from
the
be
gin
ning
un
der
the
re

we
seek
if
you
like
your
doc

you
can
keep
your
doc

If
you
like
your
pri
vate
health
in
sur
ance
plan
you
can
keep
your

Pe
riod
the
source
of
a
lot
of
these
fears
about
gov
ern
ment
-
run
health
care
is
con
fu
sion
over
what's
called
the
pub
lic
op

This
is
one
idea
among
many
to
pro
vide
more

pe

and

es
pe
cially
in
the
many

around

This

would

as
any

on
the

of
the

And
let
me
re

--
it
would
just
be
an
op

those
who
pre

their
pri

in

would
be
un

no

to

The

don't

this
idea
or
any
that
would
pro

I
get
that
And
I
ex

there
would
be
a
lot
of
dis

about
it
when
Congress

But
this
one
as

of
the
health

de

shouldn't
over
shadow
the
other
im

tant
steps
we
can
and
must
take
to
re
duce
the

ing
bur

and

So
let
me
stress
them
again:
If
you
don't
have
in
sur
ance
you
will
fi
nally
have
ac
cess
to
qual
ity
cov

you

If
you
do
have
cov

you
will
ben
e
fit
from
more
se
cu

and
more
sta
bil

when
it
comes
to
your
in
sur
ance
If
you
move
lose
your
or
change
jobs
you
will
not
have
to
worry
about
los
ing
health
cov
er
age
And
we
will
set
up
tough
con
sumer
pro
tec
tions
that
will
hold
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
ac
count
able
and
stop
them
from
ex
ploit
ing
you
with
un
fair
prac

We
'll
pro
hibit
in

com
pa

from
deny
ing
cov

be

of
a
per

med
i
cal
his

They
will
not
be
able
to
drop
your
cov
er
age
if
you
get
sick
They
will
not
be
able
to
wa

when
you

most
They
will
no
longer
be
able
to
place
some
ar
bi
trary
cap
on
the
amount
of
cov

you
can
re
ceive
in
a
given
year
or
a
life
time
We
'll
place
a
limit
on
how
much
you
can
be
charged
for
out
-
of
-
pocket
ex
penses
be
cause
no
one
in
Amer

should
go

be
cause
they
get

And
we
will
re
quire
in

com
pa

to

check

and
pre

like

There's
no
rea
son
we
shouldn't
be
catch
ing
dis
eases
like
breast
can
cer
and
colon
can
cer
on

That
makes
sense
it
saves
lives
and
it
will
also
save
money
over
the
long
-
run
Taken
to
gether
the
re
forms
we
're
seek
ing
will
help
bring
down
sky
rock
et
ing
costs
which
will
mean
real
sav
ings
for
fam
i
lies
busi
nesses
and
gov
ern

We
know
what
a
fail
ure
to
act
would
bring:
More
of
the
same
More
of
the
same
ex
plod
ing
costs
More
of
the
same
di
min
ished
cov

If
we
fail
to
the
cri
sis
will
grow
More
fam
i
lies
will
go
with
out
cov
er
age
More
busi
nesses
will
be
forced
to
drop
or
wa
ter
down
their
plans
So
we
can
push
off
the
day
of
reck
on

and
fail
to
deal
with
the
flaws
in
the
sys
tem
just
as
Wash
ing

has
done
year
af

af

Or
we
can
take
steps
that
will
pro
vide
ev

Amer

and

a
mea
sure
of
se
cu

and

that
they
lack
to

It's
never
been
easy
mov
ing
this
na
tion
for

There
are
al
ways
those
who
op
pose
it,
and
those
who
use
fear
to
block
change
But
what
has
al
ways
dis
tin
guished
Amer
ica
is
that
when
all
the
ar
gu

have
been
heard
and
all
the
con
cerns
have
been
voiced
and
the
time
comes
to
do
what
must
be
done
we
rise
above
our
dif
fer
ences
grasp
each
oth
ers
hands
and
march
for

as
one
na

and
one
peo

some
of

Democrats
some
of

Repub

cans
all
of
us
Amer
i
cans
This
is
our
chance
to
march
for

I
can't
prom
ise
you
that
the
re
forms
we
seek
will
be
per
fect
or
make
a
dif
fer
ence
overnight
But
I
can
prom
ise
you
this:
if
we
pass
health
in
sur
ance
re
form
we
will
look
back
many
years
from
now
and
this
was
the
mo
ment
we
sum
moned
what's
best
in
each
of
us
to
make
life
bet
ter
for
all
of
us.
This
was
the
mo
ment
when
we
built
a
health
care
sys
tem
wor
thy
of
the
na
tion
and
the
peo
ple
we
love
This
was
the
mo
ment
we
earned
our
place
along
side
the
great
est
gen
er
a
tions
And
that
is
what
our
gen
er
a
tion
of
Amer
i
cans
is
called
to
do
right
The
Pres
i
dent:
On
Fri
day
we
learned
that
more
than
two
dozen
peo
ple
were
killed
when
a
gun
man
opened
fire
in
an
el
e
men
tary
school
in
New
town
Con
necti

Most
of
those
who
died
were
just
young
chil
dren
with
their
whole
lives
ahead
of
them
And
ev
ery
par
ent
in
Amer
ica
has
a
heart
heavy
with
hurt
Among
the
fallen
were
also
teach
ers
--
men
and
women
who
de
voted
their
lives
to
help
ing
our
chil
dren
ful
fill
their
dreams
So
our
hearts
are
bro
ken
to
day
We
grieve
for
the
fam
i
lies
of
those
we
lost
And
we
keep
in
our
prayers
the
par
ents
of
those
who
sur
vived
Be
cause
as
blessed
as
they
are
to
have
their
chil
dren
home
they
know
that
their
child's

no

has
been
torn
away
far
too
early
As
a

we
have
en
dured
far

of
these

That's

On
Fri

we
re

bet
ter

than
we
ex

about
the
state
of
our
econ

We
learned
that
we
lost
247,000
jobs
in
July
--
some
200,000
fewer
jobs
than
we
lost
in
June
and
far
fewer
than
the
nearly
700,000
a

we
were

at
the

of

Of

this

who

their

and
to

Still

and
that
the

But
we
must
do
more
than

from

This

In

That's

That's

So,
we

or

That's

There

This

This

That's

That's

the
need
for
the
Se

to
ap
prove
the
New
START
Treaty
this

This
Treaty
is
rooted
in
a
prac

that
dates
back
to
Ron
ald
Rea
gan
The
idea
is
sim
ple
-
as
the
two
na
tions
with
over
90
per
cent
of
the
world's
nu
clear
weapons
the
United
States
and
Rus

have
a

to

to

to

And
to
en

that
our

the
United

has
an

ing
Rus

clear
ar
se
nal
through
a
ver
i
fi
ca

ef
fort
that
puts
in
spec

on
the
ground
As
Pres
i
dent
Rea
gan
said
when
he
signed
a
nu
clear
arms
treaty
with
the
Soviet
Union
in
1987
"Trust
but
ver
i
fy."
That
is
pre
cisely
what
the
new
START
Treaty
does
After
nearly
a
full
year
of
ne
go
ti
a

we
com
pleted
an
agree

lier
this

that
cuts
by
a

the

of
long

and
de

that
the
United

and
Rus
sia
can
de
ploy
while
en
sur

that
Amer
ica
re
tains
a
strong
nu
clear
de
ter
rent
and
can
put
in
spec
tors
back
on
the
ground
in
Rus
sia
The
Treaty
also
helped
us
re
set
our
re
la

with
Rus
sia
which
leads
to
con
crete
ben
e
fits
For
in
stance
Rus
sia
has
been
in
dis
pens
able
to
our
ef

to
en
force

on

to
se
cure
loose
nu
clear
ma
te
ri
als
from
ter
ror

and
to
equip
our
troops
in
Afghanistan
All
of
this
will
be
put
at
risk
if
the
Se
nate
does
not
pass
the
New

Treaty
Without
rat
i
fi

this

the
United
States
will
have
no

on

and
no

So
those
who
would

are
break

Rea

rule
-
they
want
to
trust
but
not

Without

we
put
at

the

that
we
have

to

and
the
tran

routes
through
Rus

that
we
use

And
with

we

Our

But
the

we

On

And
my

In

Create

It

Over

three
and
a

our

have
cre
ated
over
seven

a

lion

And
this

the
Trea
sury
con

that
since
I
took
of
fice
we
've
cut
our
deficits
by
more
than
half
But
we
have
more
work
to
do.
We
need
to
grow
and
cre
ate
more
good

faster
That's
my
driv
ing
fo

And
I'll
go
any

That

I
know

what
you

sound
like

-
a
jum

of
un
fo

noise
that's
out
of
touch
with
the
things
you
care
about
So
to
day
I
want
to
cut
through
that
noise
and
talk
plainly
about
what
we
should
do
right
now
to
keep
grow
ing
this
econ

and
cre
at
ing
new

It
be
gins
by

what
has
done
more
than
any

else
to
un
der

our

over

-
and
that's
the
con

cy
cle
of

and
self
-
in

wounds
I
was
glad
to
hear
the
Repub

leader
in
the

say
this

that
they
won't
pur
sue
an

shut

or

on
our

Be
cause
we
shouldn't
be
in
jur
ing
our
selves
ev

few
months
-
we
should
be
in
vest
ing
in
our

And
one
way
to
do
that
is
through
the
bud
get
that
Congress
started
work
ing
on
this
week
bud
gets
can
be
a

-
es

But
they
can
also

Be

they

We

we
could

to

that
ac

ally

We
can
keep

to

or
we

We

That's
what
this

And
the

If
we
don't

make
the

we
could

On

I've

out

And
the
num

one
is
sue
for

I

is
how
we

that

That's
the
idea
be
hind
the
Amer
i
can
Jobs
It's
a
jobs
bill
that
does
two
sim
ple
things:
put
more
peo
ple
back
to
work
and
more
money
back
in
the
pock
ets
of
peo

who
are
work

This
jobs

puts

work

back
to
work
re
build
ing
our
roads
and
bridges
and
mod
ern
iz
ing
our

This
jobs
bill
puts
teach
ers
back
in
the
class
room
and
keeps
cops
and
fire
fight

on
our
streets
This
jobs
bill
gives
tax
cred
its
to
com
pa
nies
that
hire
our
vet
er
ans
be
cause
if
you
sign
up
to
fight
for
our
coun
try
the
last
thing
you
should
have
to
do
is
fight
for
a
job
when
you
come
home
This
jobs
bill
con
nects
the
long
-
term
un
em
ployed
to
tem
po
rary
work
to
keep
their
skills
sharp
while
they
look

it
gives
hun
dreds
of
thou
sands
of
young
peo
ple
the
hope
of
a

next
sum
mer
This
jobs
bill
cuts
taxes
for
ev
ery
small
busi
ness
owner
in
Amer
ica
It
cuts
them
even
more
for
small
busi
ness
own
ers
that
hire
new
work
ers
and
raise
work
ers
salaries
And
it
cuts
taxes
for
ev
ery
work
ing
fam
ily
in
Amer
ica
so
that
you
'll
have
more
money
in
your
pock
ets
and
busi
nesses
know
they
'll
have
more
cus
tomers
to
buy
what
they
sell
That's
the
Amer
i
can
Jobs
and
you
can
check
it
out
for
your
self
on
WhiteHousegov
It
will
cre
ate
new
jobs
It
'll
cut
taxes
for
ev
ery
worker
and
small
busi
ness
in
the
coun
try
And
it
will
not
add
to
the
deficit
It
will
be
paid
On
Mon
day
I'll
lay
out
my
plan
for
how
we
'll
do
that
--
how
we
'll
pay
for
this
plan
and
pay
down
our
debt
by
fol
low
ing
some
ba
sic
prin
ci
ples:
mak
ing
sure
we
live
within
our
means
and
ask
ing
ev
ery
one
to
pay
their
fair
share
But
right
we
've
got
to
get
Congress
to
pass
this
jobs
bill
Every
thing
in
the
Amer
i
can
Jobs
Act
is
the
kind
of
idea
that's
been
sup
ported
by
Democrats
and
Repub

cans
be
fore
And
if
they
're
ideas
you
agree
with
then
ev
ery
one
of
you
can
help
make
it
hap
pen
by
telling
your
con
gressper
son
to
pass
this
jobs
bill
right
away
I
know
some
of
them
would
rather
wait
an
other
year
to
wage
an
other
elec

than
work
to
gether
right
But
most
Amer
i
cans
don't
have
the
lux
ury
of
wait
ing
It
was
three
years
ago
this

that
a

made

dif

And
too
many
are
still

as

So
the
time
for

is
No

No

No

It's

to

to

It's

to

Thanks
The
Pres
i
dent:
Over
the
last
few
months
I've
been
talk
ing
about
a
choice
we
face
as
a
coun
try
We
can
ei
ther
set
tle
for
an
econ
omy
where
a
few
peo
ple
do
re
ally
well
and
ev
ery
body
else
strug
gles
to
get
by,
or
we
can
build
an
econ
omy
where
hard
work
pays
off
again
Where
ev
ery
one
gets
a
fair
shot
Every
one
does
their
fair
share
And
ev
ery
one
plays
by
the
same
rules
That's
up
to
us.
And
to
day
I
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
idea
that
ev
ery
one
in
this
coun
try
should
do
their
fair
share
if
this
were
a
per
fect
world
we'd
have
un
lim
ited
re
sources
--
no
one
would
ever
have
to
pay
any
taxes
and
we
could
spend
as
much
as
we
wanted
But
we
live
in
the
real
world
--
we
don't
have
un
lim
ited
re
sources
We
have
a
deficit
that
needs
to
be
paid
down
And
we
also
have
to
pay
for
in
vest
ments
that
will
help
our
econ
omy
grow
and
keep
our
coun
try
safe:
Ed
u
ca
tion;
re
search
and
tech
nol
o
gy;
a
strong
mil
i
tary;
and
re
tire
ment
pro
grams
like
Medi
care
and
So
cial
Se
cu
rity
That
means
we
have
to
make
choices
When
it
comes
to
pay
ing
down
the
deficit
and
in
vest
ing
in
our
fu
ture
should
we
ask
mid
dle
-
class
Amer
i
cans
to
pay
even
more
at
a
time
when
their
bud
gets
are
al
ready
stretched
to
the
break
ing
point?
Or
should
we
ask
some
of
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
to
pay
their
fair
share?
That's
the
choice
Over
the
last
decade
we
've
spent
hun
dreds
of
bil
lions
of
dol
lars
on
what
was
sup
posed
to
be
a
tem
po
rary
tax
cut
for
the
wealth
i
est
2%
of
Amer
i
cans
Now
we
're
sched
uled
to
spend
al
most
$1
tril
lion
more
To
day
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
are
pay
ing
taxes
at
one
of
the
low
est
rates
in
50
years
War
ren
Buf
fett
is
pay
ing
a
lower
rate
than
his
sec
re
tary
Mean
while
over
the
last
30
years
the
tax
rates
for
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
have
barely
budged
That's
not
fair
It
doesn't
make
any
sense
Do
we
want
to
keep
giv
ing
tax
breaks
to
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
--
folks
like
my
self
or
War
ren
Buf
fett
or
Bill
Gates
peo
ple
who
don't
need
them
and
never
asked
for
them?
Or
do
we
want
to
keep
in
vest
ing
in
the
things
that
will
grow
our
econ
omy
and
keep
us
se
cure?
Be
cause
we
can't
af
ford
to
do
both
some
peo
ple
call
this
class
war
fare
But
I
think
ask
ing
a
bil
lion
aire
to
pay
at
least
the
same
tax
rate
as
his
sec
re
tary
is
just
com
mon
sense
We
don't
envy
suc
cess
in
this
coun
try;
we
as
pire
to
it.
But
we
also
be
lieve
that
any
one
who
does
well
for
them
selves
should
do
their
fair
share
in
re
turn
so
that
more
peo
ple
have
the
op
por
tu
nity
to
get
ahead
--
not
just
a
That's
the
Amer
ica
I
be
lieve
in,
and
in
the
next
few
weeks
mem
bers
of
Congress
will
get
a
chance
to
show
you
where
they
stand
Congress
is
go
ing
to
vote
on
what's
called
the
Buf
fett
Rule
If
you
make
more
than
$1
mil
lion
a
year
you
should
pay
at
least
the
same
per
cent
age
of
your
in
come
in
taxes
as
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
do.
On
the
other
hand
if
you
make
un
der
$250,000
a
year
--
like
98%
of
Amer
i
can
fam
i
lies
do
--
your
taxes
shouldn't
go
up.
You
're
the
ones
strug
gling
with
the
ris
ing
cost
of
ev
ery
thing
from
col

tu
ition
to

You
're
the
ones
who
de
serve

So
ev
ery
mem
ber
of
Congress
is
go
ing
to
go
on

And
if
they
vote
to
keep
on
giv

tax
breaks
to
peo

like
me
--
tax
breaks
our
coun
try
can't
af
ford
--
then
they
're
go
ing
to
have
to
ex
plain
to
you
where
that
money
comes
from
Either
it's
go
ing
to
add
to
our
deficit
or
it's
go
ing
to
come
out
of
your
pocket
Se
niors
will
have
to
pay
more
for
their
Medi
care
ben
e
fits
Stu
dents
will
see
their
in
ter
est
rates
go
up
at
a
time
when
they
can't
af
ford
it.
Fam
i

who
are
scrap
ing
by
will
have
to
do
more
be
cause
the
rich
est
Amer
i

are

That's
not
right
That's
not
who
we
In
Amer
ica
our
story
has
never
been
about
what
we
can
do
by
our

--
it's
about
what
we
can
do
to
gether
It's
about
be
liev
ing
in
our

and
the
fu

of

So
tell
your

to
do
the
right

Call
them
up;
write

a

pay

And
tell

to
stop

and
start
in

in
the
things
that
will
help
grow

and
put

That's
how

First

The
Pres
i
dent:
Hi,
ev
ery
body
Over
the
last
few
weeks
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
Medi
care
with
a
lot
of
ac
cu
sa
tions
and
mis
in
for
ma
tion
fly
ing
around
So
to
day
I
want
to
step
back
for
a
minute
and
share
with
you
some
ac
tual
facts
and
news
about
the
pro
gram
This
week
we
found
out
that
thanks
to
the
health
care
law
we
passed
nearly
5.4
mil
lion
se
niors
with
Medi
care
have
saved
over
$4.1
bil
lion
on
pre
scrip
tion
drugs
That's
an
av
er
age
of
more
than
$700
per
per
son
And
this
year
alone
18
mil
lion
se
niors
with
Medi
care
have
taken
ad
van
tage
of
pre
ven
tive
care
ben
e
fits
like
mam
mo
grams
or
other
can
cer
screen
ings
that
now
come
at
no
ex
tra
cost
That's
progress
It
means
that
se
niors
ev
ery
where
are
get
ting
the
care
they
need
for
less
And
if
you
have
ques
tions
about
what
ben
e
fits
you
're
en
ti
tled
to,
you
can
go
to

gov
to

This
news
is
also
a
re
minder
of
what's
re
ally
at
stake
when
we
talk
about
the
fu
ture
of
Medi
care
It's
not
about
over
heated
rhetoric
at
elec
tion
time
It's
about
a
prom
ise
this
coun
try
made
to
our
se
niors
that
says
if
you
put
in
a
life
time
of
hard
work
you
shouldn't
lose
your
home
or
your
life
sav
ings
just
be
cause
you
get
sick
Over
the
last
47
years
mil
lions
of
Amer
i
cans
have
worked
for
that
prom
ise
They
've
earned
it.
And
for
many
se
niors
the
care
they
've
got
ten
through
Medi
care
has
made
all
the
dif
fer
ence
in
the
world
Grow
ing
up
as
the
son
of
a
sin
gle
I
was
raised
with
the
help
of
my
grand
par
ents
I
saw
how
im
por
tant
things
like
Medi
care
and
So
cial
Se
cu
rity
were
in
their
lives
And
I
saw
the
peace
of
mind
it
gave
them
That's
as
Pres
i
dent
my
goal
has
been
to
strengthen
these
pro
grams
and
pre
serve
them
for
fu
ture
gen
er
a
tions
Be
cause
to
day's
se
niors
de
serve
that
same
peace
of
mind
And
the
mil
lions
of
Amer
i
cans
who
are
work
ing
hard
right
now
de
serve
to
know
that
the
care
they
need
will
be
avail
able
when
they
need
it.
That's
as
part
of
the
Af
ford
able
Care
we
gave
se
niors
deeper
dis
counts
on
pre
scrip
tion
drugs
and
made
sure
pre
ven
tive
care
like
mam
mo
grams
are
free
with
out
a
co
-
pay
We
've
ex
tended
the
life
of
Medi
care
by
al
most
a
decade
And
I've
pro
posed
re
forms
that
will
save
Medi
care
money
by
get
ting
rid
of
waste
ful
spend
ing
in
the
health

sys
tem
and
rein

re

that
won't

Medi
care
ben
e
fits
Not
by
a
sin
gle
dime
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
have
put
for
ward
a
very
dif
fer
ent
plan
They
want
to
turn
Medi
care
into
a
voucher
pro
gram
That
means
that
in
stead
of
be
ing
guar
an
teed
Medi
care
se
niors
would
get
a
voucher
to
buy
in
sur
ance
but
it
wouldn't
keep
up
with
costs
As
a
re
sult
one
plan
would
force
se
niors
to
pay
an
ex
tra
$6,400
a
year
for
the
same
ben
e
fits
they
get
right
And
it
would
ef
fec
tively
end
Medi
care
as
we
know
it.
I
think
our
se
niors
de
serve
bet
ter
I'm
will
ing
to
work
with
any
one
to
keep
im
prov

but
I
refuse
to
do
any
thing
that
un
der
mines
the
ba
sic
idea
of
Medi
care
as
a
guar
an

for

who
get

Here
in
Amer

we
be
lieve
in

es

who
have
put

time
of
hard
work
and
de
serve
to
en

their
golden

That's
what
Medi
care
is
all
about
That's
why
we
need
to
strengthen
and
pre

for

And
as

I

what
I'll

a
lux

we
hope
to

--
it's

we

any

The

that

has

to

Un

at

at

is
at

Repub

alike
A
few

some
of
these
im
prob
a
ble
al

com
mit
ted
to
cut
na
tional
health
care
spend
ing
by
two
tril
lion
dol
lars
over
the
next
decade
What
makes
this
so
re
mark
able
is
that
it
prob
a
bly
wouldn't
have
hap
pened
just
a
few
short
years
But
to
day
at
this
his
toric
junc
ture
even
old
ad
ver
saries
are
united
around
the
same
goal:
qual
ity
af
ford
able
health
care
for
all
Amer
i
cans
I
know
that
when
you
bring
to
gether
dis
parate
groups
with
dif
fer
ing
views
there
will
be
lively
de
bate
And
that's
a
de
bate
I
wel
come
But
what
we
can't
ac
cept
is
re
form
that
just
in
vests
more
money
in
the
sta
tus
quo
--
re
form
that
throws
good
money
af
ter
bad
habits
In
stead
we
must
at
tack
the
root
causes
of
sky
rock
et
ing
health
care
costs
some
of
these
costs
are
the
re
sult
of
un
war
ranted
prof
i
teer
ing
that
has
no
place
in
our
health
care
sys
tem
and
in
too
many
com
mu
ni
ties
folks
are
pay
ing
higher
costs
with
out
re
ceiv
ing
bet
ter
care
in
re
turn
And
yet
we
know
for
ex
am
ple
that
there
are
places
like
the
Mayo
Clinic
in
Min
nesota
the
Cleve
land
Clinic
in
Ohio
and
other
in
sti
tu
tions
that
of
fer
some
of
the
high
est
qual
ity
of
care
in
the
na
tion
at
some
of
the
low
est
costs
in
the
na
tion
We
should
learn
from
their
suc
cesses
and
pro
mote
the
best
prac
tices
not
the
most
ex
pen
sive
ones
That's
how
we
'll
achieve
re
form
that
fixes
what
doesn't
work
and
builds
on
what
does
This
week
I
con
veyed
to
Congress
my
be
lief
that
any
health
care
re
form
must
be
built
around
fun
da
men
tal
re
forms
that
lower
costs
im
prove
qual
ity
and
cov
er
age
and
also
pro
tect
con
sumer
choice
And
that
means
if
you
like
the
plan
you
have
you
can
keep
it.
If
you
like
the
doc
tor
you
have
you
can
keep
your
doc
tor
The
only
change
you
'll
see
are
fall
ing
costs
as
our
re
forms
take
hold
I've
also
made
it
very
clear
to
Congress
that
we
must
de
velop
a
plan
that
doesn't
add
to
our
bud
get
deficit
My
bud
get
in
cluded
a
his
toric
down

ment
on

and
we
'll
work
with
Congress
to
fully

the
costs
through

or

and

We

But

I've

all

even
though
Amer

uses
around
20%
of
the
world's
we
only
have
around
2%
of
the

So
even

As

I
ask

Give

To

Now

In

But
the

is

And
it's
time
to

on
our

re

to

and
de

those

speed

up

and

en
ing
the
mid
dle
class
so
that
the
Amer

can
Dream
feels
like
it's
back
within
reach
That's
why
I've
asked
to
sit
down
soon
with
lead
ers
of
both
par
ties
so
that
we
can
have
an
ex
tended
dis
cus
sion
about
what
we
can
do
to
gether
to
move
this
coun
try
for

And
over
the
next
few
weeks
we
're
go
ing
to
have
a
chance
to
work
to
gether
in
the
brief
up
com
ing
ses
sion
of
Congress
Here's
why
this
lame
-
duck
ses
sion
is
so
im
por
tant
Early
in
the
last
decade
Pres
i
dent
Bush
and
Congress
en
acted
a
se
ries
of
tax
cuts
that
were
de
signed
to
ex
pire
at
the
end
of
this
year
What
that
means
is,
if
Congress
doesn't
act
by
New
Year's
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
will
see
their
taxes
go
up
start
ing
on
New
Year's
But
the
last
thing
we
should
do
is
raise
taxes
on
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
For
the
past
decade
they
saw
their
costs
rise
their
in
comes
fall
and
too
many
jobs
go
over
seas
They
're
the
ones
bear
ing
the
brunt
of
the
re
ces
sion
They
're
the
ones
hav
ing
trou
ble
mak
ing
ends
meet
They
're
the
ones
who
need
re
lief
right
So
some
thing's
got
to
be
done
And
I
be
lieve
there's
room
for
us
to
com
pro
mise
and
get
it
done
to
gether
Let's
start
where
we
agree
All
of
us
want
cer
tainty
for
mid
dle
-
class
Amer
i
cans
None
of
us
want
them
to
wake
up
on
Jan
uary
1st
with
a
higher
tax
bill
And
that's
why
I
be
lieve
we
should
per
ma
nently
ex
tend
the
Bush
tax
cuts
for
all
fam
i
lies
mak
ing
less
than
$250,000
a
year
That's
98%
of
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
We
also
agree
on
the
need
to
start
cut
ting
spend
ing
and
bring
ing
down
our
deficit
That's
go
ing
to
re
quire
ev
ery
one
to
make
some
tough
choices
In
fact
if
Congress
were
to
im
ple
ment
my
pro
posal
to
freeze
non
-
se
cu
rity
dis
cre

spend
ing
for
three
years
it
would
bring
this
spend
ing
down
to
its
low
est
level
as
a
share
of
the
econ
omy
in
50
years
But
at
a
time
when
we
're
go
ing
to
ask
folks
across
the
board
to
make
such
dif
fi
cult
sac
ri
fices
I
don't
see
how
we
can
af
ford
to

make
all
the
Bush
tax
cuts
per
ma
nent
even
for
the

i
est
2%
of
Amer

We'd
be
dig
ging
our
selves
into
an
even
deeper
fis
cal
hole
and
pass
ing
the
bur

on
to

I
rec

that
both
par

are
go
ing
to
have
to
work
to

and
com
pro

to
get
some
thing
done
here
But
I
want
to
make
my
pri
or
i

clear
from
the
start
One:
mid

i

And

I
be

we

There

And
you

that
it's

This

Be

this

it
had
noth

It

-
tenth

af

That's

able

me.
Not
when
we
know
that
it's
the
mid

that
was
hit
the
hard
est
by
the

And
not
when
we
know
that
tak

this
money
out
of

is
ex

the

Economists
tell

this

cost

That's

I've
been
fight
ing
so
hard
to
cut

And
that's
why
I
brought
both

to

most

even

I
didn't

that

were

They'd
add
to

with
out
re

I
be
lieved
in

that
the
best
way
to

was
to

And
I
be

that

it

it's
by

And
as
with
any

ev

But
this
is
a
good

for
the
Amer
i

peo

The
vast
ma
jor
ity
of
the
tax
cuts
in
this
plan
will
help
the
mid

in
clud
ing
a
new
cut
in
pay
roll

that
will
save
the
av

fam
ily
about
$1,000
And
as
this
plan
is
de
bated
in
Congress
what
I
want
to
make
clear
is
the
real
dif
fer
ence
it
will
make
in
peo
ple's
lives
It's
go
ing
to
make
a
dif
fer
ence
for
a
sin
gle
mom
with
two
kids
in
Ohio
work
ing
as
a
cashier
With
this
plan
she'd
get
a
new
pay
roll
tax
cut
and
a
big
ger
child
tax
credit
to
gether
worth
more
than
$2,300
It's
go
ing
to
make
a
dif
fer
ence
for
a
cou
ple
in
Florida
earn
ing
about
$50,000
and
try
ing
to
put
one
of
their
two
kids
through
col

They'd
save
more
than
$4,000
be
cause
the
mid

tax
cuts
--
in
clud
ing
a
$2,500

to

And
it's
go

to
make
an

For

it

killed
more

I

The

Hi,
ev
ery
body
I'm
here
in
Ohio
where
I've
spent
the
past
cou
ple
of
days
talk
ing
with
folks
about
our
cen
tral
chal
lenge
as
a
coun
try
--
not
just
re
claim
ing
all
the
jobs
lost
to
the
re
ces
sion
but
re
claim
ing
the
eco
nomic
se
cu
rity
that
so
many
Amer
i
cans
have
lost
over
the
last
decade
Our
mis
sion
isn't
just
to
put
peo
ple
back
to
work
--
it's
to
re
build
an
econ
omy
where
that
work
pays;
an
econ
omy
in
which
ev
ery
one
who
works
hard
has
the
chance
to
get
ahead
For
months
we
've
been
push
ing
Congress
to
pass
sev
eral
com
mon
-
sense
ideas
that
will
help
us
do
that
And
on
Fri
day
I
signed
into
law
a
bill
that
will
do
two
things
for
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
First
it
will
keep
thou
sands
of
con
struc
tion
work
ers
on
the
job
re
build
ing
our
na
tion's
in
fra
struc
ture
Se
cond
it
will
keep
in
ter
est
rates
on
fed
eral
stu
dent
loans
from
dou
bling
this
year
--
which
would
have
hit
more
than
seven
mil
lion
stu
dents
with
about
a
thou
sand
dol
lars
more
on
their
loan
pay
ments
Those
steps
will
make
a
real
dif
fer
ence
in
the
lives
of
mil
lions
of
Amer
i
cans
But
make
no
mis
take:
we
've
got
more
to
do.
The
con
struc
tion
in
dus
try
was
hit
bru
tally
hard
when
the
hous
ing
bub
ble
burst
So
it's
not
enough
to
just
keep
con
struc
tion
work
ers
on
the
job
do
ing
projects
that
were
al
ready
un
der
way
For
months
I've
been
call
ing
on
Congress
to
take
half
the
money
we
're
no
longer
spend
ing
on
war
and
use
it
to
do
some
na
tion
-
build
ing
here
at
home
There's
work
to
be
done
build
ing
roads
and
bridges
and
wire
less
net
works
And
there
are
hun
dreds
of
thou
sands
of
con
struc
tion
work
ers
ready
to
do
it.
The
same
thing
is
true
for
our
stu
dents
The
bill
I'm
about
to
sign
is
vi
tal
for
mil
lions
of
stu
dents
and
their
fam
i
lies
But
it's
not
enough
to
just
keep
their
stu
dent
loan
rates
from
dou
bling
For
months
I've
been
call
ing
on

to
re

and
ex

the

that's

Hello
from

Corner

Illi

For
the
past
few

I've
been
trav
el

to
small

and
farm

here
in
the

of

I
sat
down
with
small
busi

own

in
Gut

Iowa
and
ranch

and
farm

in
Peosta
I
had

with

talked

And
to

and

let
me
just
say
one
thing
--
go
Car
di

I'm
out
here
for
one

--
I
think
Wash
ing
ton
can
learn
some
thing
from
the
folks
in
Atkin
son
and
Peosta
and
Can
non
Falls
I
think
our
coun

would
be
a
whole
lot
bet
ter
off
if
our
elected
lead
ers
showed
the
same
kind
of
dis
ci

and
in
tegrity
and
re
spon
si
bil

that
most
Amer
i
cans
demon
strate
in
their

ev
ery
sin

Be
cause
the
fact
is,
we
're
go
ing
through
a
tough
time
right
We
're
com
ing
through
a
ter
ri
ble
re
ces
sion
--
a
lot
of
folks
are
still
look
ing
for
work
A
lot
of
peo
ple
are
get
ting
by
with
smaller
pay
checks
or
less
money
in
the
cash
reg
is
ter
So
we
need
folks
in
Wash
ing
ton
--
the
peo
ple
whose
job
it
is
to
deal
with
the
coun
try's
prob
lems
the
peo
ple
who
you
elected
to
serve
--
we
need
them
to
put
aside
their
dif
fer
ences
to
get
things
done
There
are
things
we
can
do
right
now
that
will
mean
more
cus
tomers
for
busi
nesses
and
more
jobs
across
the
coun
try
We
can
cut
pay
roll
taxes
again
so
fam
i
lies
have
an
ex
tra
thou
sand
dol
lars
to
spend
We
can
pass
a
road
con
struc
tion
bill
so
con
struc
tion
crews
who
are
now
sit
ting
idle
can
head
back
to
the
work
site
re
build
ing
roads
and
bridges
and
air
ports
We
've
got
brave
skilled
Amer
i
cans
re
turn
ing
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Let's
con
nect
them
with
busi
nesses
that
could
use
their
skills
And
let's
pass
trade
deals
to
level
the
play
ing
field
for
our
busi

We
have
Amer
i
cans
driv
ing
Hyundais
and
Kias
--
well
I
want
to
see
folks
in
Korea
driv
ing
Fords
Chevys
and
Chryslers
I
want
more
prod
ucts
sold
around
the
globe
stamped
with
three
words
--
"Made
in
Amer
i
ca."
Th
ese
are
com
mon
sense
ideas
--
ideas
that
have
been
sup
ported
by
both
Democrats
and
Repub
li
cans
The
only
thing
hold
ing
them
back
is
pol
i
tics
The
only
thing
pre
vent
ing
us
from
pass
ing
these
bills
is
the
re
fusal
by
some
in
Congress
to
put
coun

ahead
of

That's

we

That's
what's

That's

Be

for
all
the

we

de

all
the

we

this

still
the

We

And
you

Al

You
can
see

along

that

You

I've
shaken

with

out

It
re
minds
me
of
why
I
got

Get

how

And
it

That's
why
it's
so
im

that

That's
why
it's

that

Be

if

The

On

I
vis

a

in
Michi

where
work

are
help

Amer

lead
the
way
in
a
grow
ing
clean
en
ergy
in
dus
try
They
were
proud
of
their
work
and
they
should
be.
They
're
not
just
show
ing
us
a
path
out
of
the
worst
re
ces
sion
in
gen
er
a
tions
--
they
're
prov
ing
that
this
is
still
a
coun
try
where
we
make
things;
where
new
ideas
take
root
and
grow;
where
the
best
uni
ver
si
ties
most
cre
ative
en
trepreneurs
and
most
dy
namic
busi
nesses
in
the
world
call
home
They
're
prov
ing
that
even
in
dif
fi
cult
times
there's
not
a
coun
try
on
Earth
that
wouldn't
trade
places
with
us.
That
doesn't
mean
we
don't
face
some
very
tough
eco
nomic
chal
lenges
Many
Amer
i
cans
are
hurt
ing
badly
right
Many
have
been
un
em
ployed
for
too
long
Put
ting
these
men
and
women
back
to
work
and
grow
ing
wages
for
ev
ery
body
has
got
to
be
our
top
pri
or
ity
But
lately
the
re
sponse
from
Wash
ing

has
been
par
ti
san
ship
and
grid
lock
that's
only
un
der
mined
pub
lic
con
fi
dence
and
hin
dered
our
ef
forts
to
grow
the
econ
omy
So
while
there's
noth
ing
wrong
with
our
coun
try
there
is
some
thing
wrong
with
our
pol
i
tics
and
that's
what
we
've
got
to
Be
cause
we
know
there
are
things
Congress
can
do,
right
to
get
more
money
back
in
your
pock
ets
get
this
econ
omy
grow
ing
faster
and
get
our
friends
and
neigh

back
to

That
pay
roll
tax
cut
that
put
$1,000
back
in
the
av

age
fam
ily's
pocket
this
year?
Let's
ex
tend
it.
Con
struc
tion
work
ers
who
've
been
job
less
since
the
hous
ing
boom
went
bust?
Let's
put
them
back
to
work
re
build
ing
Amer
ica
Let's
cut
red
tape
in
the
patent
process
so
en
trepreneurs
can
get
good
ideas
to
mar
ket
more
quickly
Let's
fin
ish
trade
deals
so
we
can
sell
more
Amer
i
can
-
made
goods
around
the
world
Let's
con
nect
the
hun

of
thou

of
brave
Amer
i

com
ing
home
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
to
busi

that
need
their
in
cred
i
ble
skills
and
tal

Th
ese
are
all
things
we
can
do
right
So
let's
do
them
And
over
the
com
ing
weeks
I'll
put
for
ward
more
pro

to
help
our
busi

and
cre

and
I
won't
stop
un
til
ev

Amer

who
wants
a

can
find
But
we
can't
let
par

san

man

get
in
our
way
--
the
idea
that
mak
ing
it
through
the
next
elec
tion
is
more
im
por
tant
than
mak
ing
things
right
That's
what's
hold
ing
us
back
--
the
fact
that
some
in
Congress
would
rather
see
their
op
po
nents
lose
than
see
Amer
ica
So
you
've
got
a
right
to
be
frus
trated
I
know
I
am.
Be
cause
you
de
serve
bet

And
I
don't
think
it's
too
much
for
you
to
ex

that
the

you
send
to
this
town
start
de

for
Mem
bers
of
Congress
are
at
home
in
their

right
And
if
you
agree
with
me
--
whether
you
're
a
Demo

or
a
Repub

can
or
not
much
of
a

let

If
you
've
had
it
with
grid
lock
and
you
want
them
to
pass
stalled

that
will
help
our
econ

right
now
--
let
them
know
If
you
refuse
to

where

if

it's

and
the
in

of

let

And
maybe
they

ready

we
've
still
got
a
long
way
to
go
to
get
to
where
we
need

We
didn't
get
into

overnight
and
it's
go

to

That's
a
hard
truth
--
but
it's
no

for

After
Amer

we
've

Our

They
had
hopes
for
the
fu

and
dreams
that
were
not
yet
ful
filled
And
if
there's
any
thing
to
take
away
from
this
tragedy
it's
a
re
minder
that
life
is
frag
ile
Our
time
here
is
lim

and
it
is
pre

And
what

in
the

are
not
the
small
and
triv

things
which
so
of

con
sume
our

It's
how
we
choose
to
treat
one
an

and
love
one
an

It's
what
we
do
on
a
daily
ba

to
give
our

mean

and
give
our

pur

That's
what
mat

That's
why
we
're
here
I'm
sure
many
of
you
who
are

had
the
same
re

I
did
when
you
first
heard

what

Michelle
and
I
will
be
for

enough
to
hug
our

a

tighter
this

end
as
I'm

you
will
do
with

But
for
those

for

we

let

we

for

as

This

I

for

for

This

I
went
to
Mem

Ten

where
I
spoke
to
the

of

Grad

But
this
com

was
es

hope
ful
--
be
cause
of
just
how
much
the
kids
at
Booker
T.
Wash

High

had
over
come
This
is
a
school
in
the
mid

of
a
tough
neigh

in
South
Mem

There's
a
lot
of
crime
There's
a
lot
of
poverty
And
just
a

only
about
half
of

at

Just
a

went

But
folks
came

to

all

Un

they

--
be

they
found
that
that's
when
a

of

were
lost
They
made
it
pos

for

to

AP

or

Most
im
por

they
didn't
just
change
the
cur
ricu

they
cre
ated
a

that
prizes

So

is
no

a

about
what's
gone
wrong
in

It's
a

about
how
we
can
set

We
need

all

We

that

driven
not
by
Wash

by

That's
how
we

The

At

a

And
more
than
any

else
what's
re

to

right
now
is
a
sense
of

What

We

around

I
took

Our

is
grow

again
and
we
've
added

for
five

But
there
are
still

of

There

that

Just

that

even

They
can
not
get

What
this
means
is
that
at
a
mo

when
our
coun
try
is
fac

so
many
chal

--
a
time
when
we
need

we
can't
get
the
qual

we
need
to
start
the

they
were
ap
pointed
to
do.
Look
the
na
ture
of
our
democ
racy
is
that
we
'll
al
ways
have
dis
agree

and
de

--
even

That's
healthy
and
it's
im

But
let's
ar
gue
over

over

And
let's
go
into
those

with
an
open

--
a

to
find
com

ground
and
a

that
in
the
one

or
an

we

Next

I'll

I
don't
ex

that
we
'll

right
away
In
fact
I
know
that
there
will
be
plenty
of
dis
agree

and
dif

But
at

it
shows
that
Repub

can
still
sit
down
to

in
an

to

We

So
I

nity
for
more
Amer
i
cans
This
week
I
or
dered
a
re
view
of
our
na
tion's
over
time
rules
to
give
more
Amer
i
cans
the
chance
to
earn
the
over
time
pay
they
've
worked
Here's
why
this
mat
ters
Our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
8.7
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
past
four
years
But
in
many
ways
the
trends
that
have
bat
tered
the
mid
dle
class
for
decades
have
grown
even
starker
While
those
at
the
top
are
do
ing
bet
ter
than
ever
av
er
age
wages
have
barely
budged
Too
many
Amer
i
cans
are
work
ing
harder
than
ever
just
to
keep
up.
We
've
got
to
build
an
econ
omy
that
works
for
ev
ery
body
not
just
a
for
tu
nate
We
know
from
our
his
tory
that
our
econ
omy
grows
best
from
the
mid
dle
when
growth
is
more
widely
shared
So
we
've
got
to
re
store
op
por
tu
nity
for
all
-
the
idea
that
with
hard
work
and
re
spon
si
bil
ity
you
can
get
ahead
for
more
than
75
years
the
40-hour
work
week
and
the
over
time
pro
tec
tions
that
come
with
it
have
helped
count
less
work
ers
climb
the
lad
der
of
suc
cess
But
to
day
an
over
time
ex
cep
tion
orig
i
nally
meant
for
highly
-
paid
em
ploy
ees
now
ap
plies
to
work
ers
who
earn
as
lit
tle
as
$23,660
a
year
It
doesn't
mat
ter
if
you
do
mostly
phys
i
cal
la
bor
or
if
you
work
50,
60,
even
70
hours
a
week
Your
em
ployer
may
not
have
to
pay
you
a
sin
gle
ex
tra
dime
In
some
cases
this
rule
makes
it
pos
si
ble
for
work
ers
earn
ing
a
salary
to
ac
tu
ally
be
paid
less
than
the
min
i
mum
wage
And
it
means
that
busi
ness
own
ers
who
treat
their
em
ploy
ees
fairly
can
be
un
der
cut
by
com
peti
tors
who
don't
That's
not
right
So
we
're
go
ing
to
up
date
those
over
time
rules
to
re
store
that
ba
sic
prin
ci
ple
that
if
you
have
to
work
more
you
should
be
able
to
earn
more
And
we
'll
do
it
by
con
sult
ing
work
ers
and
busi
nesses
and
sim
pli
fy
ing
the
sys
tem
so
it's
eas
ier
for
ev
ery
one
Amer
i
cans
have
spent
too
long
work
ing
more
and
get
ting
less
in
re
turn
So
wher
ever
and
when
ever
I
can
make
sure
that
our
econ
omy
re
wards
hard
work
and
re
spon
si
bil
ity
that's
what
I'm
go
ing
to
do.
Be
cause
what
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
wants
is
a
pay
check
that
lets
them
sup
port
their
fam
i
lies
know
a
lit
tle
eco
nomic
se
cu
rity
and
pass
down
some
hope
and
op
ti
mism
to
their
kids
That's
some
thing
worth
fight
ing
And
I'll
keep
fight
ing
for
it
as
long
as
I'm
Pres
i
dent
Thanks
and
have
a
great
week
end
Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
vis
ited
a
com
mu
nity
col
lege
in
Florida
where
I
spoke
with
stu
dents
about
what
we
need
to
do
to
make
sure
our
econ
omy
re
wards
the
hard
work
of
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
More
specif
i
cally
I
spoke
about
mak
ing
sure
our
econ
omy
re
wards
the
hard
work
of
women
To
day
women
make
up
about
half
of
our
work
force
and
more
than
half
of
our
col
lege
grad
u
ates
More
women
are
now
their
fam
i
lies
main
bread
win
ner
than
ever
be
fore
But
in
a
lot
of
ways
our
econ
omy
hasn't
caught
up
to
this
new
re
al
ity
On
av
er
age
a
woman
still
earns
just
77
cents
for
ev
ery
dol
lar
a
man
does
And
too
many
women
face
out
dated
work
place
poli
cies
that
hold
them
back
-
which
in
turn
holds
back
our
fam
i
lies
and
our
en
tire
econ
omy
A
woman
de
serves
to
earn
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
paid
leave
that
lets
you
take
a
day
off
to
care
for
a
sick
child
or
par
ent
Congress
needs
to
act
on
these
pri
or
i
ties
And
when
women
hold
most
lower
-
wage
jobs
in
Amer
ica
Congress
needs
to
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
Be
cause
no
woman
who
works
full
-
time
should
ever
have
to
raise
her
chil
dren
in
poverty
the
good
news
is
that
in
the
year
since
I
first
called
on
Congress
to
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
six
states
have
passed
laws
to
raise
theirs
More
states
coun
ties
and
cities
are
work
ing
to
raise
their
min
i
mum
wages
as
we
speak
Small
busi
nesses
like
St.
Louis
-
based
Pi
Pizze
ria
are
rais
ing
their
wages
too
-
not
out
of
char
ity
but
be
cause
it's
good
for
busi
ness
And
by
the
Pi
makes
a
re
ally
good
pizza
And
in
this
year
of
ac
tion
I
signed
an
ex
ec
u
tive
or
der
re
quir
ing
fed
eral
con
trac
tors
to
pay
their
em
ploy
ees
a
fair
wage
of
at
least
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an
hour
But
if
we
're
truly
go
ing
to
re
ward
the
hard
work
of
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
Congress
needs
to
join
the
rest
of
the
coun
try
and
pass
a
bill
that
would
lift
the
fed
eral
min
i
mum
wage
to
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an
hour
But
if
we
're
truly
go
ing
to
re
ward
the
hard
work
of
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
Congress
needs
to
join
the
rest
of
the
coun
try
and
pass
a
bill
that
would
lift
the
fed
eral
min
i
mum
wage
to
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an
hour
This
wouldn't
just
raise
wages
for
min
i
mum
wage
work
ers
-
its
ef
fects
would
lift
wages
for
nearly
28
mil
lion
Amer
i
cans
across
this
coun
try
It
will
give
busi
nesses
more
cus
tomers
with
more
money
to
spend
and
grow
the
econ
omy
for
ev
ery
body
So
call
up
your
Mem
ber
of
Congress
and
let
them
know
it's
time
for
"ten
-
ten."
It's
time
to
give
Amer
ica
a
raise
A
true
op
por
tu
nity
agenda
is
one
that
works
for
work
ing
women
Be
cause
when
women
suc
ceed
Amer
ica
suc
ceeds
We
do
bet
ter
when
ev
ery
one
par
tic
i
pates
and
when
ev
ery
one
who
works
hard
has
the
chance
to
get
ahead
That's
what
op
por
tu
nity
means
-
and
it's
why
I'll
keep
fight
ing
to
re
store
it.
Thanks
ev

and
have
a

To

there's
a

For
a

Amer

more

And
for

Let's

Both
have
talked
this
prob

to
death
with
out
do

enough
about
it.
That's
what
drives
peo
ple
nuts
about
Wash
ing
ton
Too
of
ten
it's
a
place
more
con
cerned
with
play
ing
pol

and
serv

in

than
re

real
prob

or
fo

on
what
you
're

in

But
right
we
have
a

and
an
op

--
to
re

That
means
spend

less
on
do

It
means
spend

less
on
de

pro

It
means
re

like
Medi
care
to
re
duce
costs
and
strengthen
the
pro

for

gen

And
it

tak

and

and
de

for

some
of

And
I

The
truth
is,
you
can't
solve
our

with

But
you
also
can't
solve
it
with
out

when

I
don't
think
hedge
fund
man
agers
should

than
their

And
I
don't
think
it's
fair
to
ask
noth

of
some
one
like
me
when
the
av

age
fam
ily
has
seen
their

over

and
when
many
of
you
are
just
try
ing
to
stretch

as
far
as
it
will

We
shouldn't
put
the
bur

of

re

on
the
backs
of
folks
who
've
al
ready
borne
the
brunt
of
the

It's
not
rea
son
able
and
it's
not

If
we
're

to
ask

or

or

then

We

Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
went
down
to
an
Ama
zon
ware
house
in
Ten
nessee
to
talk
more
about
what
we
need
to
do
to
se
cure
a
bet
ter
bar
gain
for
the
mid
dle
class
-
to
make
sure
that
any
one
who
works
hard
can
get
ahead
in
the
21st
cen
tury
econ
omy
Over
the
past
four
and
a
half
years
we
've
fought
our
way
back
from
the
worst
re
ces
sion
of
our
life
times
and
be
gun
to
lay
a
foun
da
tion
for
stronger
more
durable
eco
nomic
growth
To
day
our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
7.3
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
last
41
months
We
now
sell
more
prod

made
in
Amer
ica
to
the
rest
of
the
world
than
ever
be
fore
Health
care
costs
are
grow
ing
at
the
slow
est
rate
in
50
years
and
our
deficits
are
fall
ing
at
the
fastest
rate
in
60
years
But
as
any
mid
dle
-
class
fam
ily
will
tell
we
're
not
where
we
need
to
be
Even
be
fore
the
cri
sis
we
were
liv
ing
through
a
decade
where
a
few
at
the
top
were
do
ing
bet
ter
and
bet
ter
while
most
fam
i
lies
were
work
ing
harder
and
harder
just
to
get
by.
Rev
ers
ing
this
trend
must
be
Wash
ing
ton's
high
est
pri
or

It
sure
is
mine
But
too
of
ten
over
the
past
two
years
Wash
ing

has
taken
its
eye
off
the

They
've
al

and
phony

dals
to
dis
tract
from
grow
ing
our
econ
omy
and
strength
en
ing
the
mid
dle
class
That's
why
I'm
lay
ing
out
my
ideas
for
how
we
can
build
on
the
cor
ner
stones
of
what
it
means
to
be
mid
dle
class
in
Amer
ica
A
good
ed
u
ca
tion
A
home
of
your
Health
care
when
you
get
sick
A
se
cure
re
tire
ment
even
if
you
're
not
rich
And
the
most
im
por
tant
cor
ner
stone
of
all:
a
good
job
in
a
durable
grow
ing
in
dus
try
When
it
comes
to
cre
at
ing
more
good
jobs
that
pay
de
cent
wages
the
prob
lem
is
not
a
lack
of
ideas
Plenty
of
in
de
pen
dent
econ
o
mists
busi
ness
own
ers
and
peo
ple
from
both
par
ties
agree
on
what
we
have
to
do.
I
pro
posed
many
of
these
ideas
two
years
ago
in
the
Amer
i
can
Jobs
And
this
week
I
put
for
ward
com
mon
-
sense
pro
pos
als
for
how
we
can
cre
ate
more
jobs
in
man
u
fac

ing;
in
wind
so
lar
and
nat
u
ral
gas;
and
by
re
build
ing
Amer

in

What
we
're
lack
ing
is
ac
tion
from
Wash
ing

And
that's

The

All

And

The

This
is
a
time
of

when
peo

get
to

with

and
friends
to
ob

Passover
and
to

Easter
It's
a
chance
to
give
thanks
for
our
bless

and
reaf
firm
our
faith
while
spend

time
with
the
peo

we
love
We
all
know
how
im
por

that
is
--
es
pe

in
hard

And
that's
what
a
lot
of
peo

are
fac

these
days
Even
though
the
econ

is
grow
ing
again
and
we
've
seen
busi

adding
jobs
over
the
past
year
many
are
still
look
ing
for
work
And
even
if
you
haven't
faced
a
job
loss
it's
still
not
easy
out
there
Your
pay
check
isn't
get

big

while
the
cost
of
ev
ery
thing
from
col

for
your
kids
to
gas
for
your
car
keeps
go
ing
up.
That's
some
thing
on
a
lot
of
peo
ple's
minds
right
with
gas
prices
at
$4
a
gal
lon
It's
just
an
other
bur
den
when
things
were
al
ready
pretty
tough
when
ever
gas

shoot
up,
like

you

You
see
peo

try

to
grab
head
lines
or
score
a
few
points
The
truth
is,
there
is
no
sil
ver
bul
let
that
can
bring
down
gas
prices
right
away
But
there
are
a
few
things
we
can
do.

As

the
bet

is
go

that's
at

we

ing

about
the

get
Both
Democrats
and
Repub

we
need
to
re
duce
the

That's
where
we
agree
The
ques
tion
we
're
de
bat
ing
is,
how
we
do
it?
I've
pro
posed
a
bal
anced
ap
proach
that
cuts
spend
ing
while
still
in
vest
ing
in
things
like
ed
u
ca

and
clean
en

that
are
so
crit
i
cal
to
cre
at
ing
jobs
and
op
por
tu
ni
ties
for
the
mid
dle
class
It's
a
sim
ple
idea:
we
need
to
live
within
our
means
while
at
the
same
time
in
vest
ing
in
our
fu
ture
That's
why
I
so
strongly
dis
agree
with
a
pro
posal
in
Congress
that
cuts
our
in
vest
ments
in
clean
en
ergy
by
we
've
got
to
get
rid
of
waste
ful
spend
ing
--
and
make
no
mis
take
we
're
go
ing
through
ev
ery
line
of
the
bud
get
scour
ing
for
sav
ings
But
we
can
do
that
with
out
sac
ri
fic
ing
our
fu
ture
We
can
do
that
while
still
in
vest
ing
in
the
tech
nolo
gies
that
will
cre
ate
jobs
and
al
low
the
United
States
to
lead
the
world
in
new
in
dus
tries
That's
how
we
'll
not
only
re
duce
the
deficit
but
also
lower
our
de
pen
dence
on
for
eign
grow
our
econ
omy
and
leave
our
chil
dren
a
safer

And
that's
what
our
mis

has
to
be.

Hello

Ear
lier
this

I
spoke
about
our
way
for

in
Afghanistan
and
I
said
that
be
cause
the
ex

di

of
our

in
uni

civil

and
our

part

we
will
soon
be

bring

our

home
just
as
we
've
be
gun

in

After
a
decade
of

we
're
fi

bring

these

to

That's
in
the

in

And
it's
also
in
the
best
in

of

Even
though
we

our

in

di

over
the

cou

many
Amer

are
still

and
now
is
the
time
to

build

at

Of
course
there's
been
a
real
de

about
where
to
in

where
to
and
I'm
com
mit
ted
to
work

with

of
both

to
cut
our

and

But
we
can't

We
need
to
do
what's
nec
es

to

cre

mid
dle
class
jobs;
and
make
it
pos
si

for
all
Amer

That
means
giv

our

the

ca

in
the
world
so
they
have
the
knowl
edge
and
skills
to
suc

in
this
econ
omy
It
means
re
build
ing
our
crum
bling
roads
rail

and
run

And
it
means
in
vest

in
the
cut

edge
re
search
and
tech
nolo

that
will
spur
growth
in

But
the

This

is
just

ex

can
help
spur

The

in
the

yard
of
an
Al

home
and
some
one
asked
a
ques

that's
stayed
with
me.
He
asked
if
we
don't
have
homes
to
go
to,
what
good
is
an
ed
u
ca

It
was
a
heart
felt
ques
tion
one
that
could
be
asked
by
any
one
who's
lost
a
home
or
a

in

Be

if
you
're

All

All
that

The

Over

I've
been
mak
ing
the
case
that
we
need
to
act
now
on
the
Amer
i

Jobs
so
we
can
put
folks
back
to
work
and
start
build
ing
an
econ

that
lasts
into
the
fu

Ed
u
ca
tion
is
an
es
sen
tial
part
of
this
eco
nomic
agenda
It
is
an
un
de
ni
able
fact
that
coun
tries
who
out
-
ed
u
cate
us
to

will
out
-
com
pete
us
to
mor
row
Busi
nesses
will
hire
wher
ever
the
highly
-
skilled
and
highly
-
trained
work
ers
are
lo
cated
But
to
day
our
stu
dents
are
slid
ing
against
their
peers
around
the
globe
To
day
our
kids
trail
too
many
other
coun
tries
in
math
and
sci
ence
and
read
ing
As
many
as
a
quar
ter
of
our
stu
dents
aren't
even
fin
ish
ing
high
school
And
we
've
fallen
to
16th
in
the
pro
por
tion
of
our
young
peo
ple
with
a
col
lege
de
gree
even
though
we
know
that
60%
of
new
jobs
in
the
com
ing
decade
will
re
quire
more
than
a
high
school
diploma
What
this
means
is
that
if
we
're
se
ri
ous
about
build
ing
an
econ
omy
that
lasts
--
an
econ
omy
in
which
hard
work
pays
off
with
the
op
por
tu
nity
for
solid
mid
dle
class
jobs
--
we
had
bet
ter
be
se
ri
ous
about
ed
u
ca
tion
We
have
to
pick
up
our
game
and
raise
our
stan
dards
As
a
na
tion
we
have
an
obli
ga
tion
to
make
sure
that
all
chil
dren
have
the
re
sources
they
need
to
learn
--
qual
ity
schools
good
teach
ers
the
lat
est
text
books
and
the
right
tech
nol
ogy
That's
why
the
jobs
bill
I
sent
to
Congress
would
put
tens
of
thou
sands
of
teach
ers
back
to
work
across
the
coun
try
and
mod
ern
ize
at
least
35,000
schools
That's
why
Congress
should
pass
that
bill
right
But
money
alone
won't
solve
our
ed
u
ca
tion
prob
lems
We
also
need
re
form
We
need
to
make
sure
that
ev
ery
class
room
is
a
place
of
high
ex
pec
ta
tions
and
high
per
for
mance
That's
been
our
vi
sion
since
tak
ing
of
fice
And
that's
why
in
stead
of
just
pour
ing
money
into
the
sys
tem
that
wasn't
work
ing
we
launched
a
com
pe
ti
tion
called
Race
to

To
all
50
states
we
said
"If
you
show
us
the

in
no
va
tive
plans
to
im
prove
teacher
qual
ity
and
stu

achieve

we
'll
show
you
the
mon
ey."
For
less
than
1%
of
what
we
spend
on
ed
u
ca
tion
each
year
Race
to
the
Top
has
led
states
across
the
coun
try
to
raise
their
stan
dards
for
teach
ing
and
learn
ing
Th
ese
stan

were
de
vel
oped
not
by
Wash
ing

but
by
Repub

can
and
Demo
cratic
gov

nors
through
out
the

And
since
then
we
have
seen
what's
pos
si

when
re
form
isn't
just
a
top

down
man
date
but
the
work
of
lo
cal
teach

and
prin

pals;
school

and
com
mu

That's
why
in
my
State
of
the

ad
dress
this

I
said
to
Congress
you
need
to
re

the
No

that
are

Teach

are

while

are

And
in

all
over

But
for

So
I
will
Our

only
get

And

So

I
an

It's

to
give
our

the

they
need
to

This
will
make

For

yes

I
was

Ricci

in

Mas

Every

who

in

went

the

of
No

Be

was

That

From

the

our

and
our

Be

a

starts
to

their

worth
af

starts

Hi,
ev

On
Thurs

I
vis
ited
a
steel

in
Cleve
land
Ohio
to
talk
about
what
we
're
do
ing
to
re
build
our
econ

on
a
new
foun
da

for
stronger
more
durable
eco
nomic
growth
One
area
where
we
've
made
great
progress
is
Amer

can

After
years
of
talk
about
re
duc
ing
our
de

dence
on
for

we
are
ac
tu

poised
to
con

our

Shortly
af

I
took
of
fice
we
in
vested
in

Amer

can
tech
nolo

to
re
verse
our
de

dence
on
for
eign

and
dou

our

and
so
lar
power
And
to
day
we
gen
er
ate
more
re
new
able
en

than
ever
-
with
tens
of
thou
sands
of
good
Amer
i
can
jobs
to
show
for
it.
We
pro
duce
more
nat
u
ral
gas
than
any
one
-
and
nearly
ev
ery
one's
en
ergy
bill
is
lower
be
cause
of
it.
And
just
this
week
we
learned
that
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
two
decades
the
United
States
of
Amer
ica
now
pro
duces
more
of
our
own
oil
here
at
home
than
we
buy
from
other
coun
tries
That's
a
big
deal
That's
a
tremen
dous
step
to
wards
Amer
i
can
en

in
de
pen
dence
But
this
is
im
por
tant
too:
we
reached
this
mile
stone
in
part
not
only
be
cause
we
're
pro
duc
ing
more
en
ergy
but
be
cause
we
're
wast
ing
less
en
ergy
We
set
new
fuel
stan
dards
for
our
cars
and
trucks
so
that
they
'll
go
twice
as
far
on
a
gal
lon
of
gas
by
the
mid
dle
of
the
next
decade
That's
go
ing
to
save
an
av
er
age
driver
more
than
$8,000
at
the
pump
over
the
life
of
a
new
We
also
launched
ini
tia
tives
to
put
peo
ple
to
work
up
grad
ing
our
homes
busi
nesses
and
fac
to
ries
so
that
they
waste
less
en
ergy
That's
go
ing
to
save
our
busi
nesses
money
on
their
en
ergy
bills
-
that's
money
they
can
use
to
hire
more
work
ers
Here's
an
other
thing
Between
more
clean
en
ergy
and
less
wasted
en
ergy
our
emis
sions
of
dan
ger
ous
car
bon
pol
lu

are
ac
tu

fall

That's
good
news
for
any
one
who
cares
about
the
world
we
leave
to
our
kids
And
while
our
car
bon
emis

have
been
drop
ping
our
econ

has
been
grow
ing
Our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
7.8
mil
lion
new
jobs
in
the
past
44
months
It
proves
that
the
old
ar
gu
ment
that
we
can't
strengthen
the
econ
omy
and
be
good
stew
ards
of
our

at

is
a
false

We
can
do

And
we
have
to
do
both
More

Cheaper

A

Hello

Two

If

more

Amer

De

I

Th

more
than
just

--
they
're
a

of

and
a

to
the

Th

com

are
worth

they

So

Every

And
three

To

GM

Chrysler

All

the

in

has
added
more
than
200,000
new
jobs
over
the
past
two

a

years
And
they
're
not
just
build

--
they

Thanks
to
new

they

that

nearly
55

by
the

That's
al
most
dou

what
they

That
means
folks

That's

es

feel

the

from

So
what's

But
it

ev

There's

There's

We

And
we
have
to

it
The
good
news
is,
we
've

mak

Here
--
take
a
look
at
this
chart
Six
years
60%
of

Since
I

In

for
the
first
time
in
13
years
less
than
half
the

tro
leum
we
con
sumed
was
im

Part
of
that's
be
cause
we
're
pro
duc
ing
more

here
at
home
than
at
any
time
in
the
last
eight
years
But
we
can't
just
drill
our
way
out
of
this
prob

While
we
con
sume
20%
of
the
world's
we
only
have
2%
of
the

We
've

to
de

new

that
will

That's

And
be

and

Now
we
need
to
keep
at
it.
And
to
do
that
we
need
to
make
the
right
choices
Here's
one
choice
we
can
make
right
Every

the

is

We

12
straight

--
the
first
time
that's
been
true
since

The

added
1.3

last

And
each

was
stronger
than

which
means
the

Now
we

This

that

If
you

or
an

with
a

this

gives
you
dis

You
can't

you

Nearly

The

is
the

The

Hi,

One
of
the

that

Our

It's

it's
why
we

It's
why
I

It's

the

That's

with

That's

I'll

It's

from

And
while
I'm
there
I'm
go

to

ev

for

nolo

that
can

our

and
our

to

This
has
been
a
goal
of

since

On

So
when

I

And
we

But
we

Over

for

We

Al

Be

Some

And

They

And
I

Hello

As

to

Happy

and
to
talk
a

about
the

that
lies
ahead
At
the

of

we
're
still
just
emerg

from
a

We

As

that's

That's
my

for
the

Still
even
as
we
work
to
boost
our
econ

in
the

it's

to
make
some

about
how
to
keep
our

strong
grow

and
com

in

We
have
to
look
ahead
--
not
just
to
this
year
but
to
the
next
10
years
and
the
next
20
years
Where
will
new
in
no

come
from?
How
will
we
at
tract
the

of
to

to
set
up

cre

in

What
will
it
take
to
get
those

What
will
it
take
to

com

around

What
will
it
take
to
see
the
Amer

Dream
come

for
our
chil

and
grand
chil

Our
par

and
grand

asked
them

those
ques

And
be
cause
they
had
the
courage
to
an

them
we
've
had
the
good
for

to
grow
up
in
the
great
est

on
Earth
Now
it's
our
turn
to
think
about
the
fu

In
a
few
days
a
new
Congress
will
form
with
one
house
con
trolled
by
Democrats
and
one

con

--
who
now
have
a
shared
re

si
bil

to
move
this
coun

for

And
here's
what
I
want
you
to
know:
I'm
will
ing
to
work
with
any
one
of
ei
ther
party
who's
got
a
good
idea
and
the
com

to
see
it

And
we
should
all
ex
pect
you
to
hold
us
ac
count
able
for
our

or
our

to

As
I've
said
since
I
first
ran
for
this
of

solv

our

won't
be

We

decade;
one
of
new

and

we

when

But
a
new

and
a
new

stretches
out
be

us.
And
if
we
just
re
mem
ber
what
Amer

and

to
that

then
I'm

that
we
are

for
a

--
one
in
which
our

our

we

what

Thanks

If

the

is,
what

never

what
our

I
know
how
im

what

isn't
the

it's

over

I've
met
with
a

of

And
while
there's
noth

Hi,

To

our

is
grow

and
our
busi

are
con
sis

gen

at

new

But
decades
-
long
trends
still
threaten
the
mid
dle
class
While
those
at
the
top
are
do
ing
bet
ter
than
ever
too
many
Amer
i
cans
are
work
ing
harder
than
ever
but
feel
like
they
can't
get
ahead
That's
why
the
bud
get
I
sent
Congress
ear
lier
this
year
is
built
on
the
idea
of
op
por
tu

for
It
will
grow
the
mid
dle
class
and
shrink
the
deficits
we
've
al
ready
cut
in
half
since
I
took
of
fice
It's
an
op
por
tu

agenda
with
four
goals
Num
ber
one
is
cre
at
ing
more
good
jobs
that
pay
good
wages
Num
ber
two
is
train
ing
more
Amer
i
cans
with
the
skills
to
fill
those
jobs
Num
ber
three
is
guar
an
tee
ing
ev

child
ac
cess
to
a
great

And
num

four
is
mak

work

-
with

you
can
live
on,
sav
ings
you
can
re
tire
on,
and
health

that's
there
for
you
when
you
need
it.
This
week
the
Repub

cans
in
Congress
put
for
ward
a
very
dif
fer
ent
bud
get
And
it
does
just
the
op
po
site:
it
shrinks
op

and
makes
it
harder
for
Amer

who
work

to

The

can

get

by

ing
out
mas
sive
tax
cuts
to

holds
mak
ing
more
than
$1
mil
lion
a

Then
to
keep
from
blow
ing
a
hole
in
the
deficit
they'd
have
to
raise
taxes
on
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i

with

Next
their
bud
get
forces
deep
cuts
to
in

that
help
our
econ

cre
ate
jobs
like
ed
u
ca

and
sci
en
tific
re
search
they
won't
tell
you
where
these
cuts
will
fall
But
com
pared
to
my
bud
get
if
they
cut
ev
ery
thing
evenly
then
within
a
few
years
about
170,000
kids
will
be
cut
from
early
ed
u
ca

pro

About
200,000
new
moth

and
kids
will
be
cut
off
from

to
help
them
get
healthy

will
lose

sup
ports
21,000

And
if
they
want
to
make
smaller
cuts
to
one
of
these
ar
eas
that
means
larger
cuts
in
oth
ers
Un

the

It's

As
I
said
in
my
State
of

Ad
dress
ev

we
should
ask
our
selves
three
ques
tions:
How
do
we
make
Amer
ica
a
mag
net
for
good
jobs?
How
do
we
give
our
work
ers
the
skills
they
need
to
do
those
jobs?
And
how
do
we
make
sure
that
hard
work
leads
to
a
de
cent
liv
ing?
To
make
Amer
ica
a
mag

for

we
'll
in

new
roads
and
bridges
and
schools
and
cut
red
tape
to
help
busi
nesses
grow
To
give
work
ers
the
skills
they
need
to
do
those
jobs
we
'll
in
vest
in
ed

that

To

we

some
of
our
com
mu
ni
ties
hard
est
-
hit

sion
and
job
loss
All
of
these
in
vest
ments
will
help
grow
the
econ
omy
and
cre
ate
jobs
None
of
them
will
add
to
the
deficit
And
I
will

It's

We

The

for

And
yes
ter

we
learned
that
busi

added
273,000
jobs
last

All

our

have
now
cre
ated
9.2

new

over
50

But
we

to
cre

more
good
jobs
and
give
mid

class
fam
i

a
sense
of
se
cu

And
I
want
to
work
with
Congress
to
do
it.
But
so
far
this
year
Repub

in
Congress
have
blocked
or
voted
down
ev
ery
se

to

and
strengthen

They
've
said
"no"

"no"
to

That's
not
what
we

Not

there
are
still
too
many
folks
out
of

and
too
many
fam

work
ing
harder
than
ever
just
to
get
by.
That's
in
my
State
of
the
Union
Ad

I
said
that
in
this
Year
of

when

The
Pres
i
dent:
Back
in
Jan
uary
in
my
State
of
the
Union
Ad
dress
I
warned
of
the
dan
ger
posed
by
a
Supreme
Court
rul
ing
called
Ci
ti
zens
United
This
de
ci
sion
over
turned
decades
of
law
and
prece
dent
It
gave
the
spe
cial
in
ter
ests
the
power
to
spend
with
out
limit
--
and
with
out
pub
lic
dis
clo
sure
--
to
run
ads
in
or
der
to
in
flu
ence
elec
tions
as
an
elec

ap
proaches
it's
not
just
a
the
ory
We
can
see
for
our
selves
how
de
struc
tive
to
our
democ
racy
this
can
be
come
We
've
seen
it
in
the
flood
of
de

at

ads
spon
sored
by
spe

in
ter

front

with
mis

We
don't
know
who's
be

these
ads
or
who's
pay

for
them
Even
for

-
con

our

able
to

freely
in
or
der
to
swing
an
elec

to
ward
a
can
di
date
they
pre
fer
We
've
tried
to
fix
this
with
a
new
law
--
one
that
would
sim
ply
re
quire
that
you
say
who
you
are
and
who's
pay
ing
for
your
ad.
This
vot
ers
are
able
to
make
an
in
formed
judg
ment
about
a
group's
mo
ti
va

Any
one
run
ning
these
ads
would
have
to
stand
by
their
claims
And
for
eign
-
con
trolled
cor
po
ra

would
be
re
stricted
from
spend
ing
money
to
in
flu

elec
tions
just
as
they
were
be
fore
the
Supreme
Court
opened
up
this
loop
hole
This
is
com
mon
sense
In
fact
this
is
the
kind
of
pro
posal
that
Democrats
and
Repub
li
cans
have
agreed
on
for
decades
the
Repub
li
can
lead
ers
in
Congress
have
so
far
said
"no."
They
've
blocked
this
bill
from
even
com
ing
up
for
a
vote
in
the
Se
nate
It's
pol
i
tics
at
its
worst
But
it's
not
hard
to
un
der
stand
Over
the
past
two
years
we
've
fought
back
against
the
en
trenched
spe
cial
in
ter
ests
--
weak
en
ing
their
hold
on
the
levers
of
power
in
Wash
ing

We
've
taken
a
stand
against
the
worst
abuses
of
the
fi
nan

in
dus
try
and
the
health
in
sur

We
've
rolled
back
tax

for
com
pa

that
ship

over

And
we
've
re
stored
en
force

of
com
mon
sense
rules
to
pro
tect
clean
air
and
clean
wa

In
other
words
we
've
re
fused
to
go
along
with
busi
ness
as
usual
the
spe
cial
in
ter
ests
want
to
take
Congress
back
and
re
turn
to
the
days
when
lob
by

wrote
the
laws
And
a
par
ti
san
mi
nor

in
Congress
is
hop
ing
their
de
fense
of
these
spe

in
ter

and
the
sta

will
be
re

with
a

It's

ple
They
're
hop
ing
they
can
ride
this
wave
of
unchecked
in
flu
ence
all
the
way
to
vic

What's
clear
is
that
Congress
has
a
re
spon
si
bil
ity
to
But
the
truth
is,
any
law
will
prob
a
bly
come
too
late
to
pre
vent
the
dam
age
that's
al
ready
been
done
this
elec

sea
son
And
that's
any
time
you
see
an
at
tack
ad
by
one
of
these
shad
owy
groups
you
should
ask
your
self
who
is
pay
ing
for
this
ad?
Is
it
the
health
in
sur
ance
lob
by?
The
oil
in
dus
try?
The
credit
card
com
pa
nies?
More
than
that
you
can
make
sure
that
the
tens
of
mil
lions
of
dol
lars
spent
on
mis
lead
ing
ads
don't
drown
out
your
voice
Be
cause
no
mat
ter
how
many

they
run
--
no
mat
ter
how
many
elec

they
try
to
buy
--
the
power
to
de
ter
mine
the
fate
of
this
coun
try
doesn't
lie
in
their

It
lies
in
yours
It's
up
to
all
of

to

The
Pres
i
dent:
Hi,
ev
ery
body
I'm
speak
ing
to
you
to
day
from
Spring
field
Illi
nois
I
spent
eight
years
in
the
state
sen
ate
here
It
was
a
place
where
for
all
our
sur
face
dif
fer
ences
in
a
state
as
di
verse
as
Illi
nois
my
col
leagues
and
I
ac
tu
ally
shared
a
lot
in
com
mon
We
fought
for
our
prin
ci
ples
and
voted
against
each
other
but
be
cause
we
as
sumed
the
best
in
one
an
other
not
the
worst
we
found
room
for
progress
We
bridged
dif
fer
ences
to
get
things
done
In
my
trav
els
through
this
state
I
saw
most
Amer
i
cans
do
the
same
Folks
know
that
is
sues
are
com
pli
cated
and
that
peo
ple
with
dif
fer
ent
ideas
might
have
a
point
It
con
vinced
me
that
if
we
just
ap
proached
our
pol
i
tics
the
same
way
we
ap
proach
our
daily
lives
with
com
mon
sense
a
com
mit
ment
to
fair
ness
and
the
be
lief
that
we
're
all
in
this
to
gether
there's
noth
ing
we
can't
do.
That's
why
I
an
nounced
right
here
in
Spring
field
that
I
was
run
ning
for
Pres
i
dent
And
my
faith
in
the
gen
eros
ity
and
fun
da
men
tal
good

of
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
is
re
warded
ev
ery
But
I'll
be
the
first
to
ad
mit
that
the
tone
of
our
pol
i
tics
hasn't
got
ten
bet
ter
but
worse
Too
many
peo
ple
feel
like
the
sys
tem
is
rigged
and
their
voices
don't
mat
ter
And
when
good
peo
ple
are
pushed
away
from
par
tic
i
pat
ing
in
our
pub
lic
life
more
pow
er
ful
and
ex
treme
voices
will
fill
the
void
They
'll
be
the
ones
who
gain
con
trol
over
de
ci
sions
that
could
send
a
young
sol
dier
to
or
al
low
an
other
eco
nomic
cri
sis
or
roll
back
the
rights
that
gen
er
a
tions
of
Amer
i
cans
have
fought
to
se
cure
The
good
news
is
there's
also
a
lot
we
can
do
about
this
from
re
duc
ing
the
in
flu
ence
of
money
in
our
pol
i
tics
to
chang
ing
the
way
we
draw
con
gres
sional
dis
tricts
to
sim
ply
chang
ing
the
way
we
treat
each

That's
what
I
came
back
here
to
talk
about
this
week
And
I

you
check
out
my

at

One

Be

The
Pres
i
dent:
Over
the
past
week
the
United
States
has
con
tin
ued
to
lead
our
friends
and
al
lies
in
the
strat
egy
to
de
grade
and
ul
ti
mately
de
stroy
the
ter
ror
ist
group
known
as
ISIL
As
I've
said
be
fore
our
in
tel
li
gence
com
mu
nity
has
not
yet
de
tected
spe
cific
plots
from
these
ter
ror
ists
against
Amer
ica
Right
they
pose
a
threat
to
the
peo
ple
of
Iraq
Syria
and
the
broader
Mid
dle
East
But
its
lead
ers
have
threat
ened
Amer
ica
and
our
al
lies
And
if
left
unchecked
they
could
pose
a
grow
ing
threat
to
the
United
States
So,
last
month
I
gave
the
or
der
for
our
mil
i
tary
to
be
gin
tak
ing
tar
geted
ac
tion
against
ISIL
Since
then
Amer
i
can
pi
lots
have
flown
more
than
170
airstrikes
against
these
ter
ror
ists
in
Iraq
And
France
has
now
joined
us
in
these
airstrikes
Go
ing
for
ward
we
won't
hes
i
tate
to
take
ac
tion
against
these
ter
ror
ists
in
Iraq
or
in
Syria
But
this
is
not
Amer
ica's
fight
alone
I
won't
com
mit
our
troops
to
fight
ing
an
other
ground
war
in
Iraq
or
in
Syria
It's
more
ef
fec
tive
to
use
our
ca
pa
bil
i
ties
to
help
part
ners
on
the
ground
se
cure
their
own
coun
try's
fu
tures
We
will
use
our
air
power
We
will
train
and
equip
our
part
ners
We
will
ad
vise
and
we
will
as
sist
And
we
'll
lead
a
broad
coali
tion
of
na
tions
who
have
a
stake
in
this
fight
This
isn't
Amer
ica
vs.
ISIL
This
is
the
peo
ple
of
that
re
gion
vs.
ISIL
It's
the
world
vs
ISIL
We
've
been
work
ing
to
se
cure
bi
par

san
sup

for
this
strat
egy
here
at

be

I
be
lieve
that
we
are
strong
est
as
a

when
the
Pres

and
Congress
work
to

We
've
been
con

closely
with
Congress
And
last

Sec

of
De

and

their

A

of
Democrats
and
a
ma
jor

of
Repub

cans
in
both
the
House
and
the
Se

have
now
ap
proved
a
first
key
part
of
our
strat
egy
by
wide
mar

They
've
given
our
troops
the
au
thor

they
need
to
train
Syr
ian
op
po
si

fight
ers
so
that
they
can
fight
ISIL
in
Syria
Those
votes
sent
a
pow
er
ful
sig

to
the
world:
Amer

are
united
in
con
fronting
this

And
I
hope
Congress
con
tin
ues
to
make
sure
our
troops
get
what
they
need
to
get
the
job
done
Mean
while
be

we
're
lead
ing
the

more

are

our

Over
40
coun

have
of

to

the
broad

against
ISIL
so
far
-
from

And
this
week
at
the
United
Na
tions
I'll
con
tinue
to
rally
the
world
against
this
threat
This
is
an
ef
fort
that
Amer
ica
has
the
unique
abil
ity
to
lead
When
the
world
is
threat
ened;
when
the
world
needs
help;
it
calls
on
Amer
ica
And
we
call
on
our
troops
Whether
it's
to
de
grade
and
ul
ti
mately
de
stroy
a
group
of
ter
ror
ists
or
to
con
tain
and
com
bat
a
threat
like
the
Ebola
epi
demic
in
Africa;
we
ask
a
lot
of
our
troops
But
while
our
pol
i
tics
may
be
di
vided
at
times
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
stand
united
around
sup
port
ing
our
troops
and
their
fam

This
is
a

of
Amer

Thanks
to
them
it
is
a

we
will
meet
Thank
The
Pres
i
dent:
To
day
I'd
like
to
talk
with
you
about
a
sub
ject
that
I
know
is
on
ev
ery
body's
mind
and
that's
the
state
of
our
econ
omy
Yes
ter
day
we
re
ceived
a
re
port
on
our
Gross
Do
mes
tic
Prod
uct
That's
a
mea
sure
of
our
over
all
eco
nomic
per
for
mance
The
re
port
showed
that
in
the
first
few
months
of
this
year
the
re
ces
sion
we
faced
when
I
took
of
fice
was
even
deeper
than
any
one
thought
at
the
time
It
told
us
how
close
we
were
to
the
edge
But
it
also
re
vealed
that
in
the
last
few
months
the
econ
omy
has
done
mea
sur
ably
bet
ter
than
ex
pected
And
many
econ
o
mists
sug
gest
that
part
of
this
progress
is
di
rectly
at
trib
ut
able
to
the
Re
cov
ery
This
and
the
other
dif
fi
cult
but
im
por
tant
steps
that
we
've
taken
over
the
last
six
months
have
helped
put
the
brakes
on
this
re
ces
sion
We
took
un
prece
dented
ac
tion
to
stem
the
spread
of
fore
clo
sures
by
help
ing
re
spon
si
ble
home
own
ers
stay
in
their
homes
and
pay
their
mort
gages
We
helped
re
vive
the
credit
mar
kets
and
open
up
loans
for
fam
i
lies
and
small
busi
nesses
And
we
en
acted
a
Re
cov
ery
Act
that
puts
tax
cuts
di
rectly
into
the
pock
ets
of
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
and
small
busi
ness
es;
ex
tended
un
em
ploy
ment
in
sur
ance
and
health
in
sur
ance
for
folks
who
have
lost
their
jobs;
pro
vided
re
lief
to
strug
gling
states
to
pre
vent
lay
offs
of
teach
ers
and
po
lice
of
fi
cers;
and
made
in
vest
ments
that
are
putting
peo
ple
back
to
work
re
build
ing
and
ren
o
vat
ing
roads
bridges
schools
and
hos
pi
tals
I
re
al
ize
that
none
of
this
is
much
com
fort
for
Amer
i
cans
who
are
still
out
of
work
or
strug
gling
to
make
ends
meet
And
when
we
re
ceive
our
monthly
job
re
port
next
week
it's
likely
to
show
that
we
are
con
tin
u
ing
to
lose
far
too
many
jobs
in
this
coun
try
As
far
as
I'm
con
cerned
we
will
not
have
a
re
cov
ery
as
long
as
we
keep
los
ing
jobs
And
I
won't
rest
un
til
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
who
wants
a
job
can
find
But
his
tory
shows
that
you
need
to
have
eco
nomic
growth
be
fore
you
have
job
growth
And
the
re
port
yes
ter
day
on
our
econ
omy
is
an
im
por
tant
sign
that
we
're
headed
in
the
right
di
rec
tion
Busi
ness
in
vest
ment
which
had
been
plum
met
ing
in
the
past
few
months
is
show
ing
signs
of
sta
bi
liz
ing
This
means
that
even
tu
ally
busi
nesses
will
start
grow
ing
and
hir
ing
again
And
that's
when
it
will
re
ally
feel
like
a
re
cov
ery
to
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
This
won't
hap
pen
overnight
As
I've
said
be
fore
it
will
take
many
more
months
to
fully
dig
our
selves
out
of
a
re
ces
sion
--
a
re
ces
sion
that
we
've
now
learned
was
even
deeper
than
any
one
thought
But
I'll
con
tinue
to
work
ev
ery
and
take
ev
ery
step
nec
es
sary
to
make
sure
that
hap
pens
I
also
want
to
make
sure
that
we
don't
re
turn
to
an
econ
omy
where
our
growth
is
based
on
in
flated
prof
its
and
maxed
-
out
credit
cards
--
be
cause
that
doesn't
cre
ate
a
lot
of
jobs
Even
as
we
res
cue
this
econ
omy
we
must
work
to
re
build
it
stronger
than
be
fore
We
've
got
to
build
a
new
foun
da
tion
strong
enough
to
with
stand
fu
ture
eco
nomic

and
sup

last
ing
pros

Next
week
I'll
be
talk
ing
about
that
new
foun
da
tion
when
I
head
to
Elkhart
county
in
In
di
ana
--
a
city
hit
hard
not
only
by
the
eco
nomic
cri
sis
of
re
cent
months
but
by
the
broader
eco
nomic
changes
of
re
cent
decades
For
com
mu
ni
ties
like
Elkhart
to
thrive
we
need
to
re
cap
ture
the
spirit
of
in
no
va
tion
that
has
al
ways
moved
Amer
ica
for
ward
That
means
once
again
hav
ing
the
best
-
ed
u
cated
high
est
skilled
work
force
in
the
world
That
means
a
health

sys

that
makes
it
pos
si
ble
for
en
trepreneurs
to
in
no

and
busi
nesses
to
com
pete
with
out
be
ing
sad
dled
with
sky

et

in

That
means
lead
ing
the
world
in
build
ing
a
new
clean
en
ergy
econ
omy
with
the
po
ten
tial
to
un

a

of
in
no

--
and
eco
nomic
growth
--
while
end
ing
our
de

dence
on

And
that
means
in
vest
ing
in
the
re
search
and
de
vel
op

that
will
pro
duce
the
tech
nolo

of
the
fu

--
which
in
turn
will
help
cre
ate
the
in
dus
tries
and

of
the

In
no

has
been
es

to

in
the

--
and
it
will
be
es
sen

to
our

in
the

But
it's
only
by
build
ing
a

that
we
will
once

har

that
in

of

All

are

--
to

that

of

and

--
which
has
al
ways
been
at
the
heart
of
who
we
are
and
how

At
a

when

are

in
which
we
've

so
many
fail

for

it's
im

to

Every
I

from
Amer

who
are

these

who

there
are

less

and

But
I
also
know
that
if
we
do
the
things
we
know
we
must
this

will
pass
And
it
will
yield
a

The
Pres

Hello

I
hope
most
of
you

-
maybe
some

or

But
I
wanted
to
take
a
mo
ment
to
talk
to
you
about
the
real
mean
ing
of
La

Day
-
a
day
we
set
aside
ev
ery
year
to
honor
the
hard
work
ing
men
and
women
who
fought
for
so
many
of
the
rights
that
we
take
for
granted
to
day
The

Over

and

Safer

Health

Medi
care
and

All
of
those
gains
were
fought
for
and
won
by
the
la

move
ment
-
folks
who
were
work
ing
not
just
for
a
big
ger
pay
check
for
them
selves
but
for
more
se
cu
rity
and
pros
per

for
the
folks
work
ing
next
to
them
as
well
That's
how
we
built
the
great
Amer
i
can
mid
dle
class
That's
the
spirit
we
've
been
work
ing
to
re
store
these
past
six
and
a
half
years
On
Fri
day
we
found
out
that
the
econ
omy
cre
ated
an
other
173,000
jobs
in
Au
gust
Over
the
past
five
and
a
half
years
our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
13.1
mil
lion
new
jobs
in
to
tal
-
the
long
est
streak
of
job
cre
ation
on
record
The
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
dropped
to
5.1%
the
low

it's
been
in
seven
years
The
Amer

auto
in

try
is
on
track
to
sell
more
cars
and

this
year
than
it
has
in

a

Six

Amer

have
gained
the

in

Seven

states
and
about
30
cities
and
coun

have
raised
the

And
we
've
pro
posed
ex

over

pro

to
as
many
as
five

Amer
i

All
of
that
is
progress
This
month
Congress
has
an
op
por
tu
nity
to
con
tinue
that
progress
As
al
ways
the
dead
line
for
Congress
to
pass
a
bud
get
is
the
end
of
Septem
ber
Every
year
This
is
not
And
if
they
don't
they
'll
shut
down
the
gov
ern
ment
for
the
sec
ond
time
in
two
years
At
a
time
when
the
global
econ
omy
faces
head
winds
and
Amer
ica's
econ
omy
is
a
rel
a
tive
bright
spot
in
the
world
a
shut
down
of
our
gov
ern
ment
would
be
wildly
ir
re
spon
si
ble
It
would
be
an
un
forced
er
ror
that
saps
the
mo
men
tum
we
've
worked
so
hard
to
build
Plain
and
sim
ple
a
shut
down
would
hurt
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
It
doesn't
have
to
hap
pen
If
Congress
wants
to
sup
port
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
and
strengthen
our
mid
dle
class
they
can
pass
a
bud
get
that
in
vests
in,
not
makes
cuts
to,
the
mid
dle
class
If
they
pass
a
bud
get
with
short
sighted
se
quester
cuts
that
harm
our
mil
i
tary
and
our
econ
omy
I'll
veto
it.
If
they
make
smart
in
vest
ments
in
our
mil
i
tary
readi
ness
our
in
fra
struc
ture
our
schools
pub
lic
health
and
re
search
I'll
sign
that
bud
get
-
and
they
know
that
So
let's
get
it
done
Our
econ
omy
doesn't
need
an
other
round
of
threats
and
brinks
man
ship
No
body
gets
to
play
games
with
our
econ
omy
-
or
the
mid
dle
class
I
grew
up
in,
and
that
you
grew
up
in.
So
tell
Congress
to
pass
a

that

Hi,

One

Another

Nearly

The
Pres

Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
trav
eled
to
New
Eng
land
where
I
was
joined
by
four
gov
er
nors
who
are
work
ing
to
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
in
each
of
their
states
And
they
've
also
joined
me
in
call
ing
on
Congress
to
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
from
$7.25
to
$10.10
an
hour
Be
cause
it
would
give
nearly
800,000
Amer
i
cans
in
their
states
a
raise
-
and
lift
wages
for
about
28
mil
lion
across
the
coun
try
So
these
gov
er
nors
aren't
wait
ing
for
Congress
to
make
up
its
mind
And
in
my
State
of
the
Union
Ad
dress
I
asked
Amer
ica's
busi
ness
lead
ers
to
go
ahead
and
do
what
they
could
to
raise
their
em
ploy
ees
wages
And
in
creas
ingly
it's
not
just
large
com
pa
nies
like
Costco
or
the
Gap
that
choose
to
pay
their
em
ploy
ees
higher
start
ing
wages
It's
smaller
busi
nesses
like
Jax
son's
a
fam
ily
-
owned
ice
cream
par
lor
in
South
Florida
They
an
swered
the
call
and
raised
their
wages
so
that
more
than
70
em
ploy
ees
would
earn
at
least
$10.10
an
hour
with
out
cut
ting
back
on
hir
ing
And
two

But
over

we

Much

put

he's

rais

a

it's
good

good

it

six

Right
there's
a
bill
be
fore
Congress
that
would
boost
Amer

min

wage
to
$10.10
an

That's
easy
to
re
mem
ber
-
"ten

That
bill
would
lift

a

that's

Still
a

to

an

That's
progress
we

What's

true
is
that
too

there

we

one

And
as

China
is
try

That

We

We

That's

It

Our

tell

that
the

to

It
would
make
it

Ex

shows
that
it
could
also

in

to
change
their

to
evade

make

even

So
the
United

will

Be

if
we

we

And

As

Be

we

But
we

And
if

if

and
to

that
here
in
Amer

no

is
too

if

to

for

We
're
also
grate
ful
that
this

has
al

been

to
Amer
i

who
see
these

Right
as

there
are

And
it

But
in

Over

Women's
His

Month
a

not
only
to

the

that

have

but
also
the

who
have
made
that
progress
pos

One
in
spir
ing
Amer
i
can
who
comes
to
mind
is
Eleanor
Roo
sevelt
In
1961
the
for
mer
First
Lady
was
un
happy
about
the
lack
of
women
in
gov
ern
ment
so
she
marched
up
to
Pres
i
dent
Kennedy
and
handed
him
a
three
-
page
list
of
women
who
were
qual
i
fied
for
top
posts
in
his
ad
min
is
tra
tion
This
led
the
Pres
i
dent
to
se
lect
Roo
sevelt
as
the
head
of
a
new
com
mis
sion
to
look
at
the
sta
tus
of
women
in
Amer
ica
and
the
un
fair
ness
they
rou
tinely
faced
in
their
lives
Though
she
passed
away
be
fore
the
com
mis
sion
could
fin
ish
its
work
the
re
port
they
re
leased
spurred
ac
tion
across
the
coun
try
It
helped
gal
va
nize
a
move
ment
led
by
women
that
would
help
make
our
so
ci
ety
a
more
equal
place
It's
been
al
most
50
years
since
the
Roo
sevelt
com
mis
sion
pub
lished
its
find
ings
--
and
there
have
been
few
sim
i
lar
ef
forts
by
the
gov
ern
ment
in
the
decades
that
fol
lowed
That's
last
week
here
at
the
White
House
we
re
leased
a
new
com
pre
hen
sive
re
port
on
the
sta
tus
of
women
in
the
spirit
of
the
one
that
was
re
leased
half
a
cen
tury
There
was
a
lot
of
pos
i
tive
news
about
the
strides
we
've
made
even
in
re
cent
years
For
ex
am
ple
women
have
caught
up
with
men
in
seek
ing
higher
ed
u
ca
tion
In
fact
women
to
day
are
more
likely
than
men
to
at
tend
and
grad
u
ate
from
col
lege
there
are
also
re
minders
of
how
much
more
work
re
mains
to
be
done
Women
are
still
more
likely
to
live
in
poverty
in
this
coun
try
In
ed
u
ca
tion
there
are
ar
eas
like
math
and
en
gi
neer
ing
where
women
are
vastly
out
num
bered
by
their
male
coun
ter
parts
This
is
es
pe
cially
trou
bling
for
we
know
that
to
com
pete
with
na
tions
around
the
world
these
are
the
fields
in
which
we
need
to
har
ness
the
tal
ents
of
all
our
peo
ple
That's
how
we
'll
win
the
fu
ture
to
day
women
still
earn
on
av
er
age
only
about
75
cents
for
ev
ery
dol
lar
a
man
earns
That's
a
huge
dis
crep
ancy
And
at
a
time
when
folks
across
this
coun
try
are
strug
gling
to
make
ends
meet
--
and
many
fam
i
lies
are
just
try
ing
to
get
by
on
one
pay
check
af
ter
a
job
loss
--
it's
a
re
minder
that
achiev
ing
equal
pay
for
equal
work
isn't
just
a
women's
is
sue
It's
a
fam
ily
is
sue
In
one
of
my
first
acts
as
Pres
i
dent
I
signed
a
law
so
that
women
who
've
been
dis
crim
i
nated
against
in
their
salaries
could
have
their
day
in
court
to
make
it
right
But
there
are
steps
we
should
take
to
pre
vent
that
from
hap
pen
ing
in
the
first
place
That's
why
I
was
so
dis
ap
pointed
when
an
im
por
tant
bill
to
give
women
more
power
to
stop
pay
dis
par
i
ties
--
the
Pay
check
Fair
ness
Act
--
was
blocked
by
just
two
votes
in
the
Se
nate
And
that's
why
I'm
go
ing
to
keep
up
the
fight
to
pass
the
re
forms
in
that
bill
Achiev
ing
equal
ity
and
op
por
tu
nity
for
women
isn't
just
im
por
tant
to
me
as
Pres
i
dent
It's
some
thing
I
care
about
deeply
as
the
fa
ther
of
two
daugh
ters
who
wants
to
see
his
girls
grow
up
in
a
world
where
there
are
no
lim
its
to
what
they
can
achieve
As
I've
trav
eled
across
the
coun
try
vis
it
ing
schools
and
meet
ing
young
peo
ple
I've
seen
so
many
girls
pas
sion
ate
about
sci
ence
and
other
sub
jects
that
were
tra
di
tion
ally
not
open
to
them
We
even
held
a
sci
ence
fair
here
at
the
White
House
where
I
met
a
young
woman
named
Amy
Chyao
She
was
only
16
years
but
she
was
ac
tu
ally
work
ing
on
a
treat
ment
for
can
cer
She
never
thought
"S
cience
isn't
for
me."
She
never
thought
"Girls
can't
do
that."
She
was
just
in
ter
ested
in
solv
ing
a
prob
lem
And
be
cause
some
one
was
in
ter
ested
in
giv
ing
her
a
chance
she
has
the
po
ten
tial
to
im
prove
lives
That
tells
me
how
far
we
've
come
But
it
also
tells
me
we
have
to
work
even
harder
to
close
the
gaps
that
still
ex
ist
and
to
up
hold
that
sim
ple
Amer
i
can
ide
al:
we
are
all
equal
and
de
serv
ing
of
the
chance
to
pur
sue
our
own
ver
sion
of
hap
pi
ness
That's
what
Eleanor
Roo
sevelt
was
striv
ing
to
ward
half
a
cen
tury
That's
why
this
re
port
mat
ters
to

And
that's
on
be
half
of
all
our
daugh

and
all

The
Pres
i
dent:
Ear
lier
this
week
we
did
some
thing
that's
never
been
done
here
at
the
White
House
--
we
had
a
Twit
ter
Town
Hall
I
even
sent
my
first
live
tweet
as
Pres
i
dent
The
ques
tions
at
the
town
hall
were
sent
in
from
across
the
coun
try
and
cov
ered
all
kinds
of
top
ics
--
from
jobs
and
the
econ
omy
to
ed
u
ca
tion
and
en
ergy
Lots
of
peo
ple
also
sub
mit
ted
dif
fer
ent
ver
sions
of
an
other
ques
tion
They'd
start
by
say
ing
that
our
pol
i
tics
has
grown
so
con
tentious
Then
they'd
when
will
both
par
ties
in
Congress
come
to
gether
on
be
half
of
the
peo
ple
who
elected
them?
That's
a
re
ally
im
por
tant
ques
tion
and
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
a
de
bate
we
're
hav
ing
right
now
in
this
coun
try
--
and
that's
the
de
bate
about
how
to
tackle
the
prob

of
our
deficits
and
our
debt
there
are
ob
vi
ously
real
dif
fer
ences
in
ap
proach
I
be
lieve
we
need
a
bal
anced
ap
proach
That
means
tak
ing
on
spend
ing
in
our
do
mes
tic
pro
grams
and
our
de
fense
pro
grams
It
means
ad
dress
ing
the
chal
lenges
in
pro
grams
like
Medi
care
so
we
can
strengthen
those
pro
grams
and
pro
tect
them
for
fu
ture
gen
er
a
tions
And
it
means
tak
ing
on
spend
ing
in
the
tax
code
--
spend
ing
on
tax
breaks
and
de
duc
tions
for
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
But
I
also
know
that
Repub
li
cans
and
Democrats
don't
see
eye
to
eye
on
a
num
ber
of
is
sues
And
so,
we
're
go
ing
to
con
tinue
work
ing
over
the
week
end
to
bridge
those
gaps
The
good
news
is,
we
agree
on
some
of
the
big
things
We
agree
that
af
ter
a
decade
of
rack
ing
up
deficits
and
debt
we
need
to
get
our
fis
cal
house
in
or

We
agree
that
to
do
that
both
sides
are
go

to
have
to
step
out
side
of
their
com
fort
zones
and
make
some
po
lit
i
cal
sac

And
we
agree
that
we
sim

can
not
af
ford
to
de
fault
on
our
na

obli
ga
tions
for
the
first
time
in

his
to

that
we
need
to
up
hold
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
United

of
Amer

With
a
re
cov

that's
still
frag

and
isn't
pro

all
the

we
need
the
last
thing
we
can
af

is
the

Wash

By

Over

This

we
did
that
For
the
first
time
in

we
raised

the

Un

and
97%
of

will
not

all
this
was
just

in

We
still

Hello
ev

As
2011
comes
to

and
we

to

I
want
to
wish
ev

a

New

The
last
year
has
been
a
time
of
great
chal
lenge
and
great
progress
for
our
coun
try
We
ended
one
war
and
be
gan
to
wind
down
an
other
We
dealt
a
crip
pling
blow
to
al

and
made
Amer

more

We
stood
by
our
friends
and
al

around
the

through
nat

And
we
be

to
see

of

re
cov

here
at
home
even
as
too
many
Amer
i
cans
are
still
strug

to
get
ahead
There's
no
doubt
that
2012
will
bring
even
more
change
And
as
we
head
into
the
New
Year
I'm
hope
ful
that
we
have
what
it
takes
to
face
that
change
and
come
out
even
stronger
--
to
grow
our
econ
omy
cre
ate
more
jobs
and
strengthen
the
mid

I'm
hope
ful
be
cause
of
what
we
saw
right
be
fore
Christ
mas
when
Mem
bers
of
Congress
came
to
gether
to
pre
vent
a
tax
hike
for
160
mil

Amer
i

--
sav
ing
a

ily
about
$40
in
ev

They
also
made
sure
Amer
i

look

won't

their

And
I
ex
pect
Congress
to
fin
ish
the
job
by
ex
tend
ing
these
pro

through
the
end
of
2012
It
was
good
to
see
mem
bers
of
Congress
do
the
right
thing
for
mil
lions
of
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
But
it
was
only
pos
si
ble
be
cause
you
added
your

to
the

Through
email

Twit

and
over

you
let
your
rep
re

know
what
was
at

Your

Your

Your

You
had
the
courage
to
be
lieve
that
your
voices
could
make
a
dif

And
at
the
end
of
the
they
made
all
the
dif

So
more
than
any
thing
else
you
are
the
ones
who
make
me
hope
ful
about
2012
Be
cause
we
've
got
some
dif

de

and
some
tough
fights
to
come
As
I've
said
be
fore
we
are
at
a
make
-
or

break
mo

for

And
in
many
ways
the
ac

we
take
in
the
months
ahead
will
help
de
ter
mine
what
kind
of
coun

we
want
to
be,
and
what
kind
of

we
want
our

and
grand

to
grow
up
in.
As
Pres

I

I

That's

That's

And
I'm

This

the

There's
been
a

of

lately
of
the

of

But
the
truth
is,
there
were
no
win

in
this
At
a
time
when
our

needs
more
growth
and
more

the

fac

of

ac

un

The

in

has
to

Now
that
these

we

and
get

It
won't
be

But
we
can
make

Specif

about

about

Beyond

so

But
it's
the

That's
why
I
found
the

top
two
Repub

in
Congress
so
trou
bling
The
Repub

leader
of

ac
tu

said
that
"this

not

And
the
Repub

leader
of
the
Se

said
his
main

af

is

I
know
that
we
're

So
it's
not
sur
pris

that
we
're

this
heated
rhetoric
That's
pol
i

But
when
the

are

the

is

we
need
to
put

lose

In

We

Hi,

Four

af

the

cri

of
our

times
our
econ

is
grow

again
and
cre

jobs
But
we
have
much
more
to
do.
Our
task
now
is
to
build
on
that
progress
Be
cause
this
na

only
suc
ceeds
when
we
've
got
a
grow

thriv

mid

That's
what
drives
me.
That's
what
I
cam
paigned
on
for
the
past
year
That's
what
will
guide
me
in
our
work
over
the
next
four
years
And
I'm
will
ing
to
work
with
any
one
of
any
party
to
move
this
coun
try
for

Be
cause
soon
we
face
a
very
clear
dead
line
that
re
quires
us
to
make
some
big
de
ci
sions
on
jobs
and
tax
es;
on
in
vest

and

Both
par

voted
to
set
this
dead
line
And
I
be

both
par

can
work

to
make

in

When
it
comes
to
taxes
for
ex
am
ple
there
are
two
paths
avail
able
One
says
if
Congress
fails
to
act
by
the
end
of
the
year
then
ev
ery
body's
taxes
au
to
mat
i
cally
go
up
--
in
clud
ing
the
98%
of
Amer
i
cans
who
make
less
than
$250,000
a
year
Our
econ
omy
just
can't
af
ford
that
right
You
can't
af
ford
that
right
And
no
body
wants
that
to
hap
pen
The
other
path
is
for
Congress
to
pass
a
law
right
away
to
pre
vent
a
tax
hike
on
the
first
$250,000
of
any
one's
in
come
That
means
all
Amer
i
cans
--
in
clud
ing
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
--
get
a
tax
And
98%
of
Amer
i
cans
and
97%
of
all
small
busi
ness
own
ers
won't
see
their
in
come
taxes
go
up
a
sin
gle
dime
The
Se
nate
has
al
ready
passed
a
bill
like
this
Democrats
in
the
House
are
ready
to
pass
All
we
need
is
for
Repub
li
cans
in
the
House
to
come
on
board
We
shouldn't
hold
the
mid
dle
class
hostage
while
Congress
de
bates
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthy
Let's
be
gin
our
work
by
ac
tu
ally
do
ing
what
we
all
agree
on.
Let's
keep
taxes
low
for
the
mid

And
let's
get
it
done
soon

so
we
can

some

I
know
these
chal

won't
be
easy
to

But
we
can
do
it
if
we
work

That's
why
on
Fri

I
sat

It

Be

I

loud

Work
as

Don't

And
one
more
thing:
since
I
took
of

we

And
that

Think

The
Pres
i
dent:
Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
af
ter
five
years
of
ef
fort
with
eleven
other
na
tions
we
reached
agree
ment
on
a
new
trade
deal
that
pro
motes
Amer
i
can
val
ues
and
pro
tects
Amer
i
can
work
ers
There's
a
rea
son
this
Trans
-
Pa
cific
Part
ner
ship
took
five
years
to
ne
go
ti
ate
I
wanted
to
get
the
best
pos
si
ble
deal
for
Amer
i
can
work
ers
And
that
is
what
we
've
done
Here's
why
it
mat
ters
Ninety
-
five
per
cent
of
the
world's
con
sumers
live
out
side
our
bor
ders
--
95
per
cent
They
want
to
buy
Amer
i
can
prod
ucts
They
want
our
cars;
our
mu
sic;
our
food
And
if
Amer
i
can
busi
nesses
can
sell
more
of
their
prod
ucts
in
those
mar
kets
they
can
ex
pand
and
sup
port
good
jobs
here
at
home
So
it's
no
won
der
that
ex
ports
played
a
huge
role
in
help
ing
Amer
ica
re
cover
from
the
Great
Re
ces
sion
In
fact
last
year
we
set
a
new
record
for
Amer
i
can
ex
ports
for
the
fifth
year
in
a
sell
ing
more
than
$2
tril
lion
in
goods
and
ser
vices
Our
ex
ports
sup
port
roughly
12
mil
lion
Amer
i
can
jobs
--
and
they
're
jobs
that
typ
i
cally
pay
bet
ter
than
other
jobs
But
here's
the
thing:
Out
dated
trade
rules
put
our
work
ers
at
a
dis
ad
van
tage
And
TPP
will
change
that
Right
other
coun
tries
can
cut
their
costs
by
set
ting
lower
stan
dards
to
pay
lower
wages
This
trade
agree
ment
will
change
that
hold
ing
part
ner
coun
tries
to
higher
stan
dards
and
rais
ing
wages
across
a
re
gion
that
makes
up
nearly
40
per
cent
of
the
global
econ
omy
Right
other
coun
tries
charge
for
eign
taxes
on
goods
that
are
made
in
Amer
ica
Ja
pan
for
ex
am
ple
puts
a
38
per
cent
tax
on
Amer
i
can
beef
be
fore
it
even
reaches
the
mar
ket
Malaysia
puts
a
30
per
cent
tax
on
Amer
i
can
auto
parts
Viet
nam
puts
taxes
as
high
as
70
per
cent
on
ev
ery
car
Amer
i
can
au
tomak
ers
sell
there
Those
taxes
and
other
trade
bar
ri
ers
put
our
work
ers
at
a
dis
ad
van
tage
It
makes
it
more
ex
pen
sive
to
make
goods
here
and
sell
them
over
there
Well
TPP
is
go
ing
to
change
that
It
elim
i
nates
more
than
18,000
of
these
taxes
on
Amer
i
can
goods
and
ser
vices
And
that
we
're
boost
ing
Amer
ica's
farm
ers
ranch
ers
man
u
fac
tur
ers
and
small
busi
ness
own
ers
--
make
it
eas
ier
for
them
to
sell
their
prod
ucts
abroad
That's
what
it
means
to
level
the
play
ing
field
for
Amer
i
can
work
ers
and
busi
nesses
And
when
the
play
ing
field
is
level
and
the
rules
are
fair
Amer
i
cans
can
out
-
com
pete
any
body
in
the
world
I'm
the
first
per
son
who
will
say
that
past
trade
agree
ments
haven't
al
ways
lived
up
to
their
prom
ise
Some
times
they
've
been
tilted
too
much
in
the
di
rec
tion
of
other
coun
tries
and
we
haven't
got
ten
a
fair
deal
And
that
makes
folks
sus
pi
cious
of
any
new
trade
ini
tia
tives
But
let's
be
clear
Our
fu
ture
de
pends
not
on
what
past
trade
deals
did
wrong
but
on
do
ing
new
trade
deals
right
And
that's
what
the
TPP
does
It
in
cludes
the
strong
est
la
bor
stan
dards
in
his
tory
from
re
quir
ing
fair

to

and
forced
la
bor
It
in
cludes
the
strong
est
en
vi
ron
men
tal
stan
dards
in
his
tory
All
these
things
level
the
play
ing
field
for
us,
be
cause
if
they
have
to
fol
low
these
rules
then
they
can't
un
der
cut
us
and
sell
their
prod
ucts
cheaper
be
cause
they
're
vi
o
lat
ing
these
rules
And
un
like
past
trade
agree
ments
these
stan
dards
are
ac
tu
ally
en
force
able
Without
this
agree
ment
com
peti
tors
that
don't
share
our
val
ues
like
China
will
write
the
rules
of
the
global
econ
omy
They
'll
keep
sell
ing
into
our
mar
kets
and
try
to
lure
com
pa
nies
over
there;
mean
while
they
're
go
ing
to
keep
their
mar
kets
closed
to
us.
That's
what's
been
go
ing
on
for
the
last
20
years
That's
what's
con
trib
uted
so
much
to
out
sourc
ing
That's
what
has
made
it
eas
ier
for
them
to
com
pete
against
us.
And
it
needs
to
change
With
this
Trans
-
Pa
cific
Part
ner
ship
we
are
writ
ing
the
rules
for
the
global
econ
omy
Amer
ica
is
lead
ing
in
the
21st
cen
tury
Our
work
ers
will
be
the
ones
who
get
ahead
Our
busi
nesses
will
get
a
fair
deal
And
those
who
op
pose
pass
ing
this
new
trade
deal
are
re
ally
just
ac
cept
ing
a
sta
tus
quo
that
ev
ery
one
knows
puts
us
at
a
dis
ad
van
tage
Look
you
don't
have
to
take
my
word
for
it.
In
the
com
ing
weeks
and
months
you
'll
be
able
to
read
ev
ery
word
of
this
agree
ment
on
line
well
be
fore
I
sign
it.
You
'll
be
able
to
see
for
your
self
how
this
agree
ment
is
bet
ter
than
past
trade
deals
--
and
how
it's
bet
ter
for
Amer
ica's
work
ing
fam
i
lies
You
can
learn
more
at
WhiteHousegov
And
I
look
for
ward
to
work
ing
with
both
par

in
Congress
to
ap
prove
this
deal
--
and
grow
our
econ

for

to

Thanks
ev

And
have
a

The
Pres

Hi,
ev

To
day
I
want
to
talk
about
some
thing
that
most
of
you
al
ready
know
--
it's
hot
out
side
It's
re
ally
And
if
this
feels
worse
than
nor
mal
that's
be
cause
it
is.
We
just
found
out
that
July
was
the
warm
est
month
on
record
--
warmer
than
any
other
month
since
we
be
gan
keep
ing
track
more
than
a
cen
tury
On
top
of
all
this
heat
we
're
also
ex
pe
ri
enc
ing
one
of
the
worst
droughts
in
over
50
years
Al
most
a

of

United

is

we

"ex

like
Ne

Kansas
Mis

Ok
la

and
Arkansas
get

hit
harder
than

That's
bad
news
for
a
lot
of
peo
ple
but
it's
es
pe
cially
tough
on
our
farm
ers
and
ranch

Right
al
most
half
of
the
corn
crop
in
Amer
ica
is
in
poor
or
very
poor
con

Cat

are

Many
folks
are

of

And
if
we
don't
get
re

Amer

the

be
cause

We

That's

Al

But
my
Ad

can't

Congress
needs
to
do
its
part
They
need
to
pass
a
farm
bill
that
not
only
helps
farm

and
ranch

re
spond
to
these
kinds
of
dis

but
also
makes
nec
es

re

and
gives

some

That's
the
sin
gle
best
way
we
can

com

and
also
in
the
long

term
So
call
your
Mem

write

and
tell
them
that
now
is
the

to

Too
