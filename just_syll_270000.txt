The

On

in
Michi

where

help

lead
the

in
a
grow

clean
en
ergy
in
dus
try
They
were
proud
of
their
work
and
they
should
be.
They
're
not
just
show
ing
us
a
path
out
of
the
worst
re
ces
sion
in
gen
er
a
tions
--
they
're
prov
ing
that
this
is
still
a
coun
try
where
we
make
things;
where
new
ideas
take
root
and
grow;
where
the
best
uni
ver
si
ties
most
cre
ative
en
trepreneurs
and
most
dy
namic
busi
nesses
in
the
world
call
home
They
're
prov
ing
that
even
in
dif
fi
cult
times
there's
not
a
coun
try
on
Earth
that
wouldn't
trade
places
with
us.
That
doesn't
mean
we
don't
face
some
very
tough
eco
nomic
chal
lenges
Many
Amer
i
cans
are
hurt
ing
badly
right
Many
have
been
un
em
ployed
for
too
long
Put
ting
these
men
and
women
back
to
work
and
grow
ing
wages
for
ev
ery
body
has
got
to
be
our
top
pri
or
ity
But
lately
the
re
sponse
from
Wash
ing

has
been
par
ti
san
ship
and
grid
lock
that's
only
un
der
mined
pub
lic
con
fi
dence
and
hin
dered
our
ef
forts
to
grow
the
econ
omy
So
while
there's
noth
ing
wrong
with
our
coun
try
there
is
some
thing
wrong
with
our
pol
i
tics
and
that's
what
we
've
got
to
Be
cause
we
know
there
are
things
Congress
can
do,
right
to
get
more
money
back
in
your
pock
ets
get
this
econ
omy
grow
ing
faster
and
get
our
friends
and
neigh

back
to

That
pay
roll
tax
cut
that
put
$1,000
back
in
the
av

age
fam
ily's
pocket
this
year?
Let's
ex
tend
it.
Con
struc
tion
work
ers
who
've
been
job
less
since
the
hous
ing
boom
went
bust?
Let's
put
them
back
to
work
re
build
ing
Amer
ica
Let's
cut
red
tape
in
the
patent
process
so
en
trepreneurs
can
get
good
ideas
to
mar
ket
more
quickly
Let's
fin
ish
trade
deals
so
we
can
sell
more
Amer
i
can
-
made
goods
around
the
world
Let's
con
nect
the
hun
dreds
of
thou
sands
of
brave
Amer
i

com
ing
home
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
to
busi

that
need
their
in
cred
i
ble
skills
and
tal

Th
ese
are
all
things
we
can
do
right
So
let's
do
them
And
over
the
com
ing
weeks
I'll
put
for

more
pro

to
help
our
busi

and
cre

and
I
won't
stop
un
til
ev

Amer

who
wants
a

can
find
But
we
can't
let
par

san

man

get
in
our
way
--
the
idea
that
mak
ing
it
through
the
next
elec
tion
is
more
im
por
tant
than
mak
ing
things
right
That's
what's
hold
ing
us
back
--
the
fact
that
some
in
Congress
would
rather
see
their
op
po
nents
lose
than
see
Amer
ica
So
you
've
got
a
right
to
be
frus
trated
I
know
I
am.
Be
cause
you
de
serve
bet

And
I
don't
think
it's
too
much
for
you
to
ex

that
the

you

to
this
town
start
de

er

for
Mem
bers
of
Congress
are
at
home
in
their
dis

right
And
if
you
agree
with
me
--
whether
you
're
a
Demo
crat
or
a
Repub

can
or
not
much
of
a

let

If
you
've
had
it
with
grid
lock
and
you
want
them
to
pass
stalled

that
will
help
our
econ

right
now
--
let
them
know
If
you
refuse
to

where

if

it's

and
the

of

let

And
maybe
they

ready

we
've
still
got
a
long
way
to
go
to
get
to
where
we
need

We
didn't
get
into

overnight
and
it's
go

to
get

That's
a
hard
truth
--
but
it's
no
ex

for

After
Amer

not

we
've

There's

Our

Such

But
while
we
will
never

fully
what
causes
some
one
to
take
the
life
of

we
do
know
what
makes
life
worth

The
peo

we
lost
in
Aurora
loved

loved
They
were
moth

They

for
the

that

And
if
there's

it's

Our

not

triv

things
which
so

It's
how
we
choose
to

It's
what
we
do
on
a

to

our

and

That's

That's

This

This
week
I
went
to
Mem

Ten
nessee
where
I
spoke
to
the
grad

at
ing
class
of
Booker
T.
Wash
ing

High
School
Grad
u
a

are
al

happy
oc

But
this
com
mence

was
es
pe
cially
hope
ful
--
be
cause
of
just
how
much
the
kids
at
Booker
T.
Wash
ing
ton
High
School
had
over
come
This
is
a
school
in
the
mid
dle
of
a
tough
neigh
bor
hood
in
South
Mem
phis
There's
a
lot
of
crime
There's
a
lot
of
poverty
And
just
a
few
years
only
about
half
of
the
stu

at
the
school
grad
u

Just
a
hand
ful
went
off
to
col

each

But
folks
came
to
gether
to
change
all
that
Un
der
the
lead

of
a

prin

and
de

teach

they
started

for

--
be
cause
they
found
that
that's
when
a
lot
of

were
lost
They
made
it
pos
si
ble
for
stu

to
take
AP
classes
or
vo
ca

Most
im
por
tantly
they
didn't
just
change
the
cur
ricu
lum;
they
cre
ated
a
cul

that
prizes
hard

and
dis

that

So
Booker

is
no
longer
a

about
what's
gone
wrong
in

It's
a

about
how
we
can
set

We
need

this

all

We

that
are
driven
not
by
Wash

by

That's
how
we

At

And
more
than

what's

is
a

Our

we

But
there
are

even

They
can
not

What
this
means
is
that
at
a
mo

when
our
coun

is
fac

so
many
chal

--
a
time
when
we

we
can't

we
need
to
start
the

they
were
ap
pointed
to

Look
the
na
ture
of
our
democ
racy
is
that
we
'll
al
ways
have
dis
agree

and

even

That's
healthy
and
it's

But
let's

over

And
let's
go

with
an

--
a

to

a

that
in

we

Next

I
don't
ex

that
we
'll

right

In
fact
I
know
that
there
will
be
plenty
of
dis
agree

and
dif

But
at

it
shows
that
Repub

can
still
sit
down
to

in
an

So
I

Hi,
ev

In
this
year
of
ac

I'm
do

ev

I
with

with
out
Congress
to
ex
pand
op
por

for

Amer
i

This
week
I
or
dered
a
re
view
of
our
na

over
time
rules
to
give
more
Amer
i
cans
the
chance
to
earn
the
over
time
pay
they
've
worked
Here's
why
this
mat
ters
Our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
8.7
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
past
four
years
But
in
many
ways
the
trends
that
have
bat
tered
the
mid
dle
class
for
decades
have
grown
even
starker
While
those
at
the
top
are
do
ing
bet
ter
than
ever
av
er
age
wages
have
barely
budged
Too
many
Amer
i
cans
are
work
ing
harder
than
ever
just
to
keep
up.
We
've
got
to
build
an
econ
omy
that
works
for
ev
ery
body
not
just
a
for
tu
nate
We
know
from
our
his
tory
that
our
econ
omy
grows
best
from
the
mid
dle
when
growth
is
more
widely
shared
So
we
've
got
to
re
store
op
por
tu
nity
for
all
-
the
idea
that
with
hard
work
and
re
spon
si
bil

you
can
get
ahead
for
more
than
75
years
the
40-hour
work
week
and
the
over
time
pro
tec

that
come
with
it
have
helped
count
less
work
ers
climb
the

of

But
to
day
an
over

ex
cep

orig

nally
meant
for
highly

paid
em
ploy
ees
now
ap
plies
to
work
ers
who
earn
as
lit
tle
as
$23,660
a

It
doesn't
mat
ter
if
you
do
mostly
phys

cal
la

or
if
you
work
50,
60,
even
70
hours
a
week
Your
em
ployer
may
not
have
to
pay
you
a

In
some
cases
this
rule
makes
it
pos
si
ble
for
work
ers
earn
ing
a
salary
to
ac
tu
ally
be
paid
less
than
the
min

And
it
means
that
busi

own
ers
who
treat
their

ees
fairly
can
be
un
der

by
com

who

That's
not

So
we
're
go

to
up

those
over

rules
to

that
ba
sic

that
if
you

you
should

And
we
'll
do
it
by

and

so
it's

for
ev

Amer

have
spent
too

get

So
wher

and
when

I
can
make

that

that's
what
I'm

Be

what

and
pass

That's

Thanks
and

a
great
week
end
Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
vis
ited
a
com
mu
nity
col
lege
in
Florida
where
I
spoke
with
stu
dents
about
what
we
need
to
do
to
make
sure
our
econ
omy
re
wards
the
hard
work
of
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
More
specif
i
cally
I
spoke
about
mak
ing
sure
our
econ
omy
re
wards
the
hard
work
of
women
To
day
women
make
up
about
half
of
our
work
force
and
more
than
half
of
our
col
lege
grad
u
ates
More
women
are
now
their
fam
i
lies
main
bread
win
ner
than
ever
be
fore
But
in
a
lot
of
ways
our
econ
omy
hasn't
caught
up
to
this
new
re
al
ity
On
av
er
age
a
woman
still
earns
just
77
cents
for
ev
ery
dol
lar
a
man
does
And
too
many
women
face
out
dated
work
place
poli
cies
that
hold
them
back
-
which
in
turn
holds
back
our
fam
i
lies
and
our
en
tire
econ
omy
A
woman
de
serves
to
earn
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
paid
leave
that
lets
you
take
a
day
off
to
care
for
a
sick
child
or
par
ent
Congress
needs
to
act
on
these
pri
or
i
ties
And
when
women
hold
most
lower
-
wage
jobs
in
Amer
ica
Congress
needs
to
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
Be
cause
no
woman
who
works
full
-
time
should
ever
have
to
raise
her
chil
dren
in
poverty
the
good
news
is
that
in
the
year
since
I
first
called
on
Congress
to
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
six
states
have
passed
laws
to
raise
theirs
More
states
coun
ties
and
cities
are
work
ing
to
raise
their
min
i
mum
wages
as
we
speak
Small
busi
nesses
like
St.
Louis
-
based
Pi
Pizze
ria
are
rais
ing
their
wages
too
-
not
out
of
char
ity
but
be
cause
it's
good
for
busi
ness
And
by
the
Pi
makes
a
re
ally
good
pizza
And
in
this
year
of
ac
tion
I
signed
an
ex
ec
u
tive
or
der
re
quir
ing
fed
eral
con
trac
tors
to
pay
their
em
ploy
ees
a
fair
wage
of
at
least
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an
hour
But
if
we
're
truly
go
ing
to
re
ward
the
hard
work
of
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
Congress
needs
to
join
the
rest
of
the
coun
try
and
pass
a
bill
that
would
lift
the
fed
eral
min
i
mum
wage
to
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an
hour
But
if
we
're

to

the

Congress
needs

that
would
lift
the
fed

min
i
mum
wage
to
ten
dol

This
wouldn't
just
raise
wages
for
min
i
mum
wage
work
ers
-
its
ef
fects
would
lift
wages
for
nearly
28
mil
lion
Amer
i
cans
across
this
coun
try
It
will
give
busi
nesses
more
cus
tomers
with
more
money
to
spend
and
grow
the
econ
omy
for
ev
ery
body
So
call
up
your
Mem
ber
of
Congress
and
let
them
know
it's
time
for
"ten
-
ten."
It's
time
to
give
Amer
ica
a
raise
A
true
op
por
tu
nity
agenda
is
one
that
works
for
work

Be

when

We
do

ev

and
when
ev

who
works
hard
has
the
chance
to
get

That's
what
op

means
-
and
it's
why
I'll
keep

to
re

it.
Thanks

Both

to

with

That's
what
drives

nuts
about

Too

it's
a

more

That

It

It

And

The

is,
you

But

I
don't

And
I
don't
think
it's

when
the

We

It's

If

Hi,
ev

This

I
went
down
to
an
Ama
zon

in
Ten

to
talk
more
about
what
we
need
to
do
to
se
cure
a
bet

for
the
mid

-
to
make
sure
that
any
one
who
works
hard
can
get
ahead
in
the
21st
cen
tury
econ
omy
Over
the
past
four
and
a
half
years
we
've
fought
our
way
back
from
the
worst
re
ces
sion
of
our

times
and
be
gun
to
lay
a
foun
da

for
stronger
more
durable
eco

growth
To
day
our
busi

have
cre
ated
7.3
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
last
41
months
We
now
sell
more
prod

made
in
Amer

to
the
rest
of
the
world
than
ever
be
fore
Health
care
costs
are
grow
ing
at
the
slow
est
rate
in
50
years
and
our
deficits
are
fall
ing
at
the
fastest
rate
in
60
years
But
as
any
mid
dle
-
class
fam
ily
will
tell
we
're
not
where
we
need
to
be
Even
be
fore
the
cri

we
were
liv
ing
through
a
decade
where
a
few
at
the
top
were
do
ing
bet

and
bet
ter
while
most
fam
i

were
work
ing
harder
and
harder
just
to
get
by.
Rev

ing
this
trend
must
be
Wash

est

It
sure
is

But
too
of

over
the

Wash

taken
its

off

They

our

and
strength
en

the

That's
why
I'm
lay
ing
out
my
ideas
for
how
we
can
build
on
the
cor

stones
of
what
it
means
to
be
mid

in
Amer

A
good

A
home
of
your
Health

when
you
get

A

re

even
if
you
're
not

And
the
most
im
por
tant
cor

stone
of
all:
a
good

in
a
durable
grow
ing
in
dus

When
it
comes
to
cre
at
ing
more
good

that
pay
de

the
prob

is
not
a
lack

Plenty

o

own

and

from
both

we

I
pro

many
of
these
ideas
two

in

And
this

I

What

And
that's
in
ad

to

that
we
know
will

I've
also
put

The

All

And
I

The
Pres

This
is
a
time
of

when
peo

get
to
gether
with
fam
ily
and
friends
to
ob
serve
Passover
and
to
cel
e
brate
Easter
It's
a
chance
to
give
thanks
for
our
bless
ings
and
reaf
firm
our
faith
while
spend
ing
time
with
the
peo
ple
we
love
We
all
know
how
im
por
tant
that
is
--
es
pe
cially
in
hard
times
And
that's
what
a
lot
of
peo
ple
are
fac
ing
these
days
Even
though
the
econ
omy
is
grow
ing
again
and
we
've
seen
busi
nesses
adding
jobs
over
the
past
year
many
are
still
look
ing
for
work
And
even
if
you
haven't
faced
a
job
loss
it's
still
not
easy
out
there
Your
pay
check
isn't
get
ting
big
ger
while
the
cost
of
ev
ery
thing
from
col
lege
for
your
kids
to
gas
for
your
car
keeps
go
ing
up.
That's
some
thing
on
a
lot
of
peo
ple's
minds
right
with
gas
prices
at
$4
a
gal
lon
It's
just
an
other
bur
den
when
things
were
al
ready
pretty
tough
when
ever
gas
prices
shoot
up,
like
clock
work
you
see
politi

rac

wav

for

You
see
peo

try

to
grab
head
lines
or
score
a
few
points
The
truth
is,
there
is
no
sil
ver
bul
let
that
can
bring
down
gas
prices
right
away
But
there
are
a
few
things
we
can
do.

As

the
bet

is
go

that's
at

we

ing

about
the

get
Both
Democrats

we
need

the

That's
where
we
agree
The
ques
tion
we
're
de
bat
ing
is,
how
we
do
it?
I've
pro
posed
a
bal
anced
ap
proach
that
cuts
spend
ing
while
still
in
vest
ing
in
things
like
ed
u
ca

and
clean
en

that
are
so
crit
i
cal
to
cre
at
ing
jobs
and
op
por
tu
ni
ties
for
the
mid
dle
class
It's
a
sim
ple
idea:
we
need
to
live
within
our
means
while
at
the
same
time
in
vest
ing
in
our
fu
ture
That's
why
I
so
strongly
dis
agree
with
a
pro
posal
in
Congress
that
cuts
our
in
vest
ments
in
clean
en
ergy
by
we
've
got
to
get
rid
of
waste
ful
spend
ing
--
and
make
no
mis
take
we
're
go
ing
through
ev
ery
line
of
the
bud
get
scour
ing
for
sav
ings
But
we
can
do
that
with
out
sac
ri
fic
ing
our
fu
ture
We
can
do
that
while
still
in
vest
ing
in
the
tech
nolo
gies
that
will
cre
ate
jobs
and
al
low
the
United
States
to
lead
the
world
in
new
in
dus
tries
That's
how
we
'll
not
only
re
duce
the
deficit
but
also
lower
our
de
pen
dence
on
for
eign
grow
our
econ
omy
and
leave
our
chil
dren
a
safer

And
that's
what
our
mis

has
to
be.

Hello

Ear
lier
this

I
spoke
about
our

for

in
Afghanistan
and
I
said
that
be

the
ex

di

of
our

in
uni

civil

and
our

part

we
will
soon
be

bring

our

home
just
as
we
've
be
gun

in
Iraq
After
a
decade
of

we
're
fi

bring

these

to

That's
in
the

in

And
it's
also
in
the
best
in

of

Even
though
we

turned
our

in

di

over
the

cou

of

many
Amer

are
still

and
now
is
the
time
to
fo

build

here
at

Of
course
there's
been
a
real
de

about
where
to
in

and
where
to
and
I'm
com
mit
ted
to
work

with

of
both

to
cut
our

and

But
we
can't

We

to

what's
nec
es

to

mid

class
jobs;
and
make
it
pos
si

for
all
Amer

That
means
giv

the

ca

in
the
world
so
they
have
the
knowl
edge
and
skills
to
suc

in
this
econ
omy
It
means
re
build
ing
our
crum
bling
roads
rail

and
run

And
it
means
in
vest

in
the
cut

edge
re

nolo

that
will
spur
growth
in

But
the

This

is
just

ex

can

in
the
back
yard
of
an
Al

home
and
some
one
asked
a
ques

that's
stayed
with
me.
He
asked
if
we
don't
have
homes
to
go
to,
what
good
is
an
ed
u
ca

It
was
a
heart
felt
ques
tion
one
that
could
be
asked
by
any
one
who's
lost
a
home
or
a

in

Be

if
you

clo

All

All
that

That's

In

The

Over
the
last
few
weeks
I've
been
mak
ing
the
case
that
we
need
to
act
now
on
the
Amer
i
can
Jobs
so
we
can
put
folks
back
to
work
and
start
build
ing
an
econ
omy
that
lasts
into
the
fu
ture
Ed
u
ca
tion
is
an
es
sen
tial
part
of
this
eco
nomic
agenda
It
is
an
un
de
ni
able
fact
that
coun
tries
who
out
-
ed
u
cate
us
to
day
will
out
-
com
pete
us
to
mor
row
Busi
nesses
will
hire
wher
ever
the
highly
-
skilled
and
highly
-
trained
work
ers
are
lo
cated
But
to
day
our
stu
dents
are
slid
ing
against
their
peers
around
the
globe
To
day
our
kids
trail
too
many
other
coun
tries
in
math
and
sci
ence
and
read
ing
As
many
as
a
quar
ter
of
our
stu
dents
aren't
even
fin
ish
ing
high
school
And
we
've
fallen
to
16th
in
the
pro
por
tion
of
our
young
peo
ple
with
a
col
lege
de
gree
even
though
we
know
that
60%
of
new
jobs
in
the
com
ing
decade
will
re
quire
more
than
a
high
school
diploma
What
this
means
is
that
if
we
're
se
ri
ous
about
build
ing
an
econ
omy
that
lasts
--
an
econ
omy
in
which
hard
work
pays
off
with
the
op
por
tu
nity
for
solid
mid
dle
class
jobs
--
we
had
bet
ter
be
se
ri
ous
about
ed
u
ca
tion
We
have
to
pick
up
our
game
and
raise
our
stan
dards
As
a
na
tion
we
have
an
obli
ga
tion
to
make
sure
that
all
chil
dren
have
the
re
sources
they
need
to
learn
--
qual
ity
schools
good
teach
ers
the
lat
est
text
books
and
the
right
tech
nol
ogy
That's
why
the
jobs
bill
I
sent
to
Congress
would
put
tens
of
thou
sands
of
teach
ers
back
to
work
across
the
coun
try
and
mod
ern
ize
at
least
35,000
schools
That's
why
Congress
should
pass
that
bill
right
But
money
alone
won't
solve
our
ed
u
ca
tion
prob
lems
We
also
need
re
form
We
need
to
make
sure
that
ev
ery
class
room
is
a
place
of
high
ex
pec
ta
tions
and
high
per
for
mance
That's
been
our
vi
sion
since
tak
ing
of
fice
And
that's
why
in
stead
of
just
pour
ing
money
into
the
sys
tem
that
wasn't
work
ing
we
launched
a
com
pe
ti
tion
called
Race
to
the
To
all
50
states
we
said
"If
you
show
us
the
most
in
no
va
tive
plans
to
im
prove
teacher
qual
ity
and
stu
dent
achieve
ment
we
'll
show
you
the
mon
ey."
For
less
than
1%
of
what
we
spend
on
ed
u
ca
tion
each
year
Race
to
the
Top
has
led
states
across
the
coun
try
to
raise
their
stan
dards
for
teach
ing
and
learn
ing
Th
ese
stan
dards
were
de
vel
oped
not
by
Wash
ing
ton
but
by
Repub
li
can
and
Demo
cratic
gov
er
nors
through
out
the
coun
try
And
since
then
we
have
seen
what's
pos
si
ble
when
re
form
isn't
just
a
top
-
down
man
date
but
the
work
of
lo
cal
teach
ers
and
prin
ci
pals;
school
boards
and
com
mu
ni

That's
why
in
my
State
of
the
Union
ad
dress
this
year
I
said
to
Congress
you
need
to
re

the
No

No

has

that
the

has
some

flaws
that
are
hurt
ing
our

in

of

Teach

are
be

forced
to
teach
to

while

like
his

and

are
be

And
in

some

Th

have
been

to

ed

all
over
this

for

But
for

So
I
will
Our

only
get

at

And
they
can't
af

So
yes

I
an

'll

to

It's

ways
to
give
our

the

they
need
to
com

for

of

This
will
make
a

in

of

all

For
ex

yes

I
was
with
Ricci

the

of

in

Mas

Every

who

in

went

But
be

the

of
No

Be

Ricci's

was

That

From

Hi,

This

to

that
af

-
the

the

of

Sex

is

And
it's
about
all
of
us
-
the
safety
of
those
we
love
most:
our

our

our
daugh

and
our

Be

when
a
child
starts
to

their
self
-
worth
af

be
ing
abused
and
maybe
starts

a

drops

Over

we

stepped

And
this

we

An

Hi,

On
Thurs

I
vis

a

in
Cleve

Ohio
to
talk
about
what
we
're
do
ing
to
re

our

on
a
new
foun
da

for
stronger
more
durable
eco

growth
One
area
where
we
've
made
great
progress
is
Amer

After
years
of
talk
about
re

our

dence
on

we
are
ac
tu

poised
to

Shortly
af

I
took
of

we
in

in

to
re

our
de

for

and
dou

our

and
so

And
to

we
gen

ate
more
re
new
able
en

than
ever
-
with
tens
of
thou
sands
of
good
Amer
i
can
jobs
to
show
for
it.
We
pro
duce
more
nat
u
ral
gas
than
any
one
-
and
nearly
ev
ery
one's
en
ergy
bill
is
lower
be
cause
of
it.
And
just
this
week
we
learned
that
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
two
decades
the
United
States
of
Amer
ica
now
pro
duces
more
of
our
own
oil
here
at
home
than
we
buy
from
other
coun

That's
a
big
deal
That's
a
tremen
dous
step
to
wards
Amer
i
can
en

in
de
pen
dence
But
this
is
im
por
tant
too:
we
reached
this
mile
stone
in
part
not
only
be
cause
we
're
pro
duc
ing
more
en
ergy
but
be
cause
we
're
wast
ing
less
en
ergy
We
set
new
fuel
stan
dards
for
our
cars
and
trucks
so
that
they
'll
go
twice
as
far
on
a
gal
lon
of
gas
by
the
mid
dle
of
the
next
decade
That's
go
ing
to
save
an
av
er
age
driver
more
than
$8,000
at
the
pump
over
the
life
of
a
new
We
also
launched
ini
tia
tives
to
put
peo
ple
to
work
up
grad
ing
our
homes
busi
nesses
and
fac
to
ries
so
that
they
waste
less
en

That's
go
ing
to
save
our
busi
nesses
money
on
their
en
ergy
bills
-
that's
money
they
can
use
to
hire
more
work
ers
Here's
an
other
thing
Between
more
clean
en
ergy
and
less
wasted
en
ergy
our
emis
sions
of
dan
ger
ous
car
bon
pol

are

That's
good
news
for
any
one
who
cares
about
the

we
leave
to
our

And
while
our

bon
emis

have

drop

our

has
been
grow
ing
Our
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
7.8
mil
lion
new

in
the
past
44
months
It
proves
that
the
old
ar
gu

that
we
can't
strengthen
the
econ
omy
and
be
good
stew
ards
of

at

is
a

We

And
we

More

Cheaper

Hello

Ear

Two

If

if

more

Amer

De

I

Th

worth
more
than
just

--
they
're
a

of

and
a

to
the

Th

com

are
worth

they

a

So

We

Every

And
three

To

GM

Chrysler

All

the

in

has
added
more
than
200,000
new
jobs
over
the
past
two

a

years
And
they
're
not
just
build

--
they

Thanks
to
new

they

that

nearly
55

by
the

That's
al

what
they

That

sav

That's

es

as

feel
ing
the
pinch
from

So
what's

Detroit
will
make

But
it
won't
solve
ev

There's
no

let

There's

We

And
we
have
to

The
good

is,
we
've

Here
--
take
a
look
at
this
chart
Six
years
60%
of

Since

In

for
the
first
time
in
13
years
less
than
half
the

we
con

was

Part
of
that's
be
cause
we
're
pro

ing
more

here
at
home
than
at
any
time
in
the
last
eight

But
we
can't
just
drill
our
way
out
of
this
prob

While
we
con
sume
20%
of
the
world's
we
only
have
2%
of

We
've

to

that

That's

Now
we
need
to
keep
at
it.
And
to
do
that
we
need
to
make
the
right
choices
Here's
one
choice
we
can
make
right
Every

Last

we
know
that
these

But
the
trend
is
clear
We
saw
12
straight
months
of
pri

sec
tor
job
growth
--
the
first
time
that's
been
true
since
2006
The
econ
omy
added
1.3
mil
lion
jobs
last
year
And
each
quar
ter
was
stronger
than
the
last
which
means
the
pace
of
hir

is
pick

up.
Now
we
're
see
ing
more
op

mistic
eco

fore

for
the

in

due
to
the

I

I

while
we

we

a

The

rocked

of

left

So,
our

This

For

So,

This

that

If
you
're

or

with
a

this

gives
you
dis

You

Nearly

is

The

in

is
the
low

since
we
be

The

This

It's
