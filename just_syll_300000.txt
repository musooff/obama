This

--
a
tax
hike
of
$2,200
for

Now
it
comes
down
to
this:
If
218
Mem

of

98%
of
Amer

97%
of

own

will
have
the
cer

of
know

that
their

That

means
some

to
a

who's
al

It
means
some

That's
se
cu

at
a

when

could

And
here's
the
thing:
ev

Every

says
they
agree
that
we
should
ex

When
Democrats
and
Repub

agree
on
some

it
should
be
pretty
easy
to
get
it
done
But
right
that's

And
I

by

That's

to

about
the

that
lies

At
the

of

we
're
still
just

from

We

That's
my

for
the

Still
even
as
we
work
to
boost
our

in
the

it's

to
make

about
how
to
keep
our

grow

and
com

We
have
to
look
ahead
--
not
just
to
this

but
to
the
next
10
years
and
the
next
20
years
Where
will

How
will

What

What

What
will
it
take
to

Dream
come

for

Our

asked
them

those

And
be

they
had

courage
to

we

had
the

to
grow
up
in
the

on

Now
it's
our
turn
to
think
about
the

In
a

a

Congress
will
form
with
one

con

and

who
now
have

to

And
here's
what
I
want
you
to

I'm
will

to

who's

But
a

And
if

then
I'm

And
if

to

that

Un

It's
a

But

And
it

As
I
said
in
my
State
of
the
Union
Ad
dress
ev

we
should
ask
our
selves
three
ques
tions:
How
do
we
make
Amer
ica
a
mag
net
for
good
jobs?
How
do
we
give
our
work
ers
the
skills
they
need
to
do
those
jobs?
And
how
do
we
make
sure
that
hard
work
leads
to
a
de
cent
liv
ing?
To
make
Amer
ica
a
mag
net
for
good

we
'll
in

in

new
roads
and
bridges
and
schools
and
cut
red
tape
to
help
busi
nesses
grow
To
give
work
ers
the
skills
they
need
to
do
those
jobs
we
'll
in
vest
in
ed
u

that

job

To
make
sure
hard

we
'll

tal
iz

some
of
our
com
mu
ni
ties
hard
est
-
hit
by

ces
sion
and
job
loss
All
of
these
in
vest
ments
will
help
grow
the
econ
omy
and
cre
ate
jobs
None
of
them
will
add
to
the
deficit
And
I
will
lay
out
these
pri
or
i

in
greater
de

in
the
days
ahead
It's
a
bud
get

be

our

And
it's
a
bud
get
that
doesn't
make
harsh
and
un
nec
es

cuts
that
only
serve
to
slow
our
econ
omy
We
'll
keep
our
prom
ise
to
an
ag

gen
er

by
shoring
up
Medi

And
we

And
yes
ter

we

that

All

have
now
cre

9.2

to
cre

more
good
jobs
and
give
mid

class
fam
i

a
sense
of
se
cu

And
I
want
to
work
with
Congress
to
do
it.
But
so
far
this
year
Repub

in
Congress
have
blocked
or
voted
down
ev

to

They
've
said
"no"

"no"

That's

Not

too
many

and
too

work

harder
than
ever
just
to

That's
in
my
State
of

Ad

I
said
that
in

when

as

The
Pres
i
dent:
Back
in
Jan
uary
in
my
State
of
the
Union
Ad

I
warned
of
the

ger
posed
by
a
Supreme

rul
ing
called
Ci

zens
United
This
de
ci
sion
over
turned
decades
of
law
and
prece

It
gave
the
spe

in
ter
ests
the
power
to
spend
with
out
limit
--
and
with
out
pub
lic
dis
clo
sure
--
to
run
ads
in
or
der
to
in
flu

elec

as
an
elec

ap
proaches
it's
not
just
a
the
ory
We
can
see
for
our
selves
how
de
struc

to
our
democ
racy
this
can
be
come
We
've
seen
it
in
the

of

spon
sored
by

in

with

We
don't
know
who's
be

these

or
who's

for
them
Even
for

con

our

able
to

freely
in
or
der
to
swing
an
elec

to
ward
a

di
date
they
pre
fer
We
've
tried
to
fix
this
with
a
new
law
--
one
that
would
sim
ply
re
quire
that
you
say
who
you
are
and
who's
pay

for
your
ad.
This
vot

are
able
to
make
an
in

judg

about
a
group's
mo

Any

run

these

would
have
to
stand
by
their

And
for
eign
-
con

would
be
re

from

to

elec

just
as
they
were
be
fore
the
Supreme
Court
opened
up
this
loop

This
is
com
mon
sense
In
fact
this
is
the
kind
of
pro
posal
that
Democrats
and
Repub
li
cans
have
agreed
on
for
decades
the
Repub
li
can
lead

in
Congress
have
so
far
said
"no."
They
've
blocked
this
bill
from
even
com
ing
up
for
a
vote
in
the
Se

It's
pol
i
tics
at
its
worst
But
it's
not
hard
to
un
der
stand
Over
the
past
two
years
we
've
fought
back
against
the
en
trenched
spe

in
ter
ests
--
weak
en
ing
their
hold
on
the
levers
of
power
in
Wash

We
've
taken
a
stand
against
the
worst
abuses
of
the

in

and
the
health
in

com

We
've
rolled
back
tax

for

that
ship

over

And
we
've
re
stored
en
force

of

mon

rules
to

clean

and
clean

In
other
words
we
've
re
fused
to
go
along
with

as

the
spe

in

back

Hi,
ev
ery
body
I'm
speak
ing
to
you
to
day
from
Spring
field
Illi
nois
I
spent
eight
years
in
the
state
sen
ate
here
It
was
a
place
where
for
all
our
sur
face
dif
fer
ences
in
a
state
as
di
verse
as
Illi
nois
my
col
leagues
and
I
ac
tu
ally
shared
a
lot
in
com
mon
We
fought
for
our
prin
ci
ples
and
voted
against
each
other
but
be
cause
we
as
sumed
the
best
in
one
an
other
not
the
worst
we
found
room
for
progress
We
bridged
dif
fer
ences
to
get
things
done
In
my
trav
els
through
this
state
I
saw
most
Amer
i
cans
do
the
same
Folks
know
that
is
sues
are
com
pli
cated
and
that
peo
ple
with
dif
fer
ent
ideas
might
have
a
point
It
con
vinced
me
that
if
we
just
ap
proached
our
pol
i
tics
the
same
way
we
ap
proach
our
daily
lives
with
com
mon
sense
a
com
mit
ment
to
fair
ness
and
the
be
lief
that
we
're
all
in
this
to
gether
there's
noth
ing
we
can't
do.
That's
why
I
an
nounced
right
here
in
Spring
field
that
I
was
run
ning
for
Pres
i
dent
And
my
faith
in
the
gen
eros
ity
and
fun
da
men
tal
good
ness
of
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
is
re
warded
ev
ery
But
I'll
be
the
first
to
ad
mit
that
the
tone
of
our
pol
i
tics
hasn't
got
ten
bet
ter
but
worse
Too
many
peo
ple
feel
like
the
sys
tem
is
rigged
and
their
voices
don't
mat
ter
And
when
good
peo
ple
are
pushed
away
from
par
tic
i
pat
ing
in
our
pub
lic
life
more
pow
er
ful
and
ex
treme
voices
will
fill
the
void
They
'll
be
the
ones
who
gain
con
trol
over
de
ci
sions
that
could
send
a
young
sol
dier
to
or
al
low
an
other
eco
nomic
cri
sis
or
roll
back
the
rights
that
gen
er
a
tions
of
Amer
i
cans
have
fought
to
se
cure
The
good
news
is
there's
also
a
lot
we
can
do
about
this
from
re
duc
ing
the
in
flu
ence
of
money
in
our

to
chang
ing
the
way
we

con
gres

dis

to

chang

the

That's
what
I
came
back
here
to
talk
about
this

And
I

out

at

One

The
Pres

Over
the
past
week
the
United
States
has
con
tin
ued
to
lead
our
friends
and
al
lies
in
the
strat
egy
to
de
grade
and
ul
ti
mately
de
stroy
the
ter
ror
ist
group
known
as
ISIL
As
I've
said
be
fore
our
in
tel
li
gence
com
mu
nity
has
not
yet
de
tected
spe
cific
plots
from
these
ter
ror
ists
against
Amer
ica
Right
they
pose
a
threat
to
the
peo
ple
of
Iraq
Syria
and
the
broader
Mid
dle
East
But
its
lead
ers
have
threat
ened
Amer
ica
and
our
al
lies
And
if
left
unchecked
they
could
pose
a
grow
ing
threat
to
the
United
States
So,
last
month
I
gave
the
or
der
for
our
mil
i
tary
to
be
gin
tak
ing
tar
geted
ac

against
ISIL
Since
then
Amer
i
can
pi
lots
have
flown
more
than
170
airstrikes
against
these
ter
ror
ists
in
Iraq
And
France
has
now
joined
us
in
these
airstrikes
Go
ing
for
ward
we
won't
hes
i
tate
to
take
ac
tion
against
these
ter
ror
ists
in
Iraq
or
in
Syria
But
this
is
not
Amer
ica's
fight
alone
I
won't
com
mit
our
troops
to
fight
ing
an
other
ground
war
in
Iraq
or
in
Syria
It's
more
ef
fec
tive
to
use
our
ca
pa
bil
i
ties
to
help
part
ners
on
the
ground
se
cure
their
own
coun
try's
fu

We
will
use
our
air
power
We
will
train
and
equip
our
part
ners
We
will
ad
vise
and
we
will
as
sist
And
we
'll
lead
a
broad
coali
tion
of
na

who
have
a
stake
in
this
fight
This
isn't
Amer
ica
vs.
ISIL
This
is
the
peo
ple
of
that
re

vs.
ISIL
It's
the
world
vs
ISIL
We
've
been

to

bi
par

for
this

here
at

be

I
be

that
we
are

as
a

when
the
Pres

and
Congress
work

We
've

And

A

of
Democrats
and
a

of
Repub

in
both
the
House
and
the
Se

have
now
ap
proved
a
first
key
part
of
our

by
wide

They
've
given
our

the

they
need
to

Syr
ian
op
po

fight

so
that
they
can
fight
ISIL
in
Syria
Those
votes
sent
a
pow

to
the
world:
Amer

are

in

this

And
I
hope
Congress
con

ues
to
make
sure
our

get
what
they
need
to
get
the
job
done
Mean
while
be

we
're
lead

more

Over
40

have

so

from

And
this
week
at
the
United
Na

I'll
con
tinue
to
rally
the
world
against
this
threat
This
is
an
ef
fort
that
Amer
ica
has
the
unique
abil
ity
to
lead
When
the
world
is
threat
ened;
when
the
world
needs
help;
it
calls
on
Amer
ica
And
we
call
on
our
troops
Whether
it's
to
de
grade
and
ul
ti
mately
de
stroy
a
group
of
ter
ror
ists
or
to
con
tain
and
com
bat
a
threat
like
the
Ebola
epi
demic
in
Africa;
we
ask
a
lot
of
our
troops
But
while
our
pol
i
tics
may
be
di
vided
at
times
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
stand
united
around
sup
port
ing
our

and
their
fam

This
is
a

Thanks
to

it
is

we

Thank
The
Pres
i
dent:
To
day
I'd
like
to
talk
with
you
about
a
sub
ject
that
I
know
is
on
ev
ery
body's
mind
and
that's
the
state
of
our
econ
omy
Yes
ter
day
we
re
ceived
a
re
port
on
our
Gross
Do
mes
tic
Prod
uct
That's
a
mea
sure
of
our
over
all
eco
nomic
per
for
mance
The
re
port
showed
that
in
the
first
few
months
of
this
year
the
re
ces
sion
we
faced
when
I
took
of
fice
was
even
deeper
than
any
one
thought
at
the
time
It
told
us
how
close
we
were
to
the
edge
But
it
also
re
vealed
that
in
the
last
few
months
the
econ
omy
has
done
mea
sur
ably
bet
ter
than
ex
pected
And
many
econ
o
mists
sug
gest
that
part
of
this
progress
is
di
rectly
at
trib
ut
able
to
the
Re
cov
ery
This
and
the
other
dif
fi
cult
but
im
por
tant
steps
that
we
've
taken
over
the
last
six
months
have
helped
put
the
brakes
on
this
re
ces
sion
We
took
un
prece
dented
ac
tion
to
stem
the
spread
of
fore
clo
sures
by
help
ing
re
spon
si
ble
home
own
ers
stay
in
their
homes
and
pay
their
mort
gages
We
helped
re
vive
the
credit
mar
kets
and
open
up
loans
for
fam
i
lies
and
small
busi
nesses
And
we
en
acted
a
Re
cov
ery
Act
that
puts
tax
cuts
di
rectly
into
the
pock
ets
of
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
and
small
busi
ness
es;
ex
tended
un
em
ploy
ment
in
sur
ance
and
health
in
sur
ance
for
folks
who
have
lost
their
jobs;
pro
vided
re
lief
to
strug
gling
states
to
pre
vent
lay
offs
of
teach
ers
and
po
lice
of
fi
cers;
and
made
in
vest
ments
that
are
putting
peo
ple
back
to
work
re
build
ing
and
ren
o
vat
ing
roads
bridges
schools
and
hos
pi
tals
I
re
al
ize
that
none
of
this
is
much
com
fort
for
Amer
i
cans
who
are
still
out
of
work
or
strug
gling
to
make
ends
meet
And
when
we
re
ceive
our
monthly
job
re
port
next
week
it's
likely
to
show
that
we
are
con
tin
u
ing
to
lose
far
too
many
jobs
in
this
coun
try
As
far
as
I'm
con
cerned
we
will
not
have
a
re
cov
ery
as
long
as
we
keep
los
ing
jobs
And
I
won't
rest
un
til
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
who
wants
a
job
can
find
But
his
tory
shows
that
you
need
to
have
eco
nomic
growth
be
fore
you
have
job
growth
And
the
re
port
yes
ter
day
on
our
econ
omy
is
an
im
por
tant
sign
that
we
're
headed
in
the
right
di
rec
tion
Busi
ness
in
vest
ment
which
had
been
plum
met
ing
in
the
past
few
months
is
show
ing
signs
of
sta
bi
liz
ing
This
means
that
even
tu
ally
busi
nesses
will
start
grow
ing
and
hir
ing
again
And
that's
when
it
will
re
ally
feel
like
a
re
cov
ery
to
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
This
won't
hap
pen
overnight
As
I've
said
be
fore
it
will
take
many
more
months
to
fully
dig
our
selves
out
of
a
re
ces
sion
--
a
re
ces
sion
that
we
've
now
learned
was
even
deeper
than
any
one
thought
But
I'll
con
tinue
to
work
ev
ery
and
take
ev
ery
step
nec
es
sary
to
make
sure
that
hap
pens
I
also
want
to
make
sure
that
we
don't
re
turn
to
an
econ
omy
where
our
growth
is
based
on
in
flated
prof
its
and
maxed
-
out
credit
cards
--
be
cause
that
doesn't
cre
ate
a
lot
of
jobs
Even
as
we
res
cue
this
econ
omy
we
must
work
to
re
build
it
stronger
than
be
fore
We
've
got
to
build
a
new
foun
da
tion
strong
enough
to
with
stand
fu
ture
eco
nomic
storms
and
sup
port
last
ing
pros
per

Next
week
I'll
be
talk
ing
about
that
new
foun
da
tion
when
I
head
to
Elkhart
county
in
In
di
ana
--
a
city
hit
hard
not
only
by
the
eco
nomic
cri
sis
of
re
cent
months
but
by
the
broader
eco
nomic
changes
of
re
cent
decades
For
com
mu
ni
ties
like
Elkhart
to
thrive
we
need
to
re
cap
ture
the
spirit
of
in
no
va
tion
that
has
al
ways
moved
Amer
ica
for
ward
That
means
once
again
hav
ing
the
best
-
ed
u
cated
high
est
skilled
work
force
in
the
world
That
means
a
health
care
sys

that
makes
it
pos
si
ble
for
en
trepreneurs
to
in
no
vate
and
busi
nesses
to
com
pete
with
out
be
ing
sad
dled
with
sky
rock
et
ing
in
sur

That
means
lead
ing
the
world
in
build
ing
a
new
clean
en
ergy
econ
omy
with
the
po
ten
tial
to
un

a

in

va

--
and
eco
nomic
growth
--
while
end
ing
our

dence
on

And
that
means
in
vest

in
the
re

and
de

op

that
will
pro
duce
the
tech
nolo

of
the

--
which
in
turn
will
help
cre
ate
the
in

and

of
the

In
no

has
been

in

--
and
it
will

Hello

-
a

we
set

ev

to
honor
the

who
fought
for
so

All
of

folks
who
were

but
for

for

That's
how
we

That's
the

we
've
been
work

On

we

that

173,000

Over

All
of

This

Congress
has
an

to

that

As
al

the
dead

for
Congress
to
pass
a

is
the
end
of
Septem

Every

This
is
not
And
if
they
don't
they
'll
shut
down
the

for
the

in
two

At
a
time
when
the
global
econ

faces
head
winds
and
Amer

econ

is
a
rel
a

bright
spot
in
the

a
shut

of
our

would
be
wildly
ir

It
would
be
an
un

that
saps
the

tum
we
've
worked
so

to

Plain
and
sim
ple
a
shut

would
hurt
work
ing
Amer
i

It
doesn't
have
to
hap
pen
If
Congress
wants
to
sup
port
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
and
strengthen
our
mid
dle

they
can
pass
a
bud

that

not

the

If
they
pass
a

with
short

se

that
harm
our
mil

and
our

I'll
veto
it.
If
they

in

our

I'll
sign
that

and
they
know
that
So
let's
get
it
done
Our

doesn't
need
an

No

with
our

or
the

I
grew

and
that

So
tell

to

One

Nearly

The
Pres

Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
trav
eled
to
New
Eng
land
where
I
was
joined
by
four
gov
er
nors
who
are
work
ing
to
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
in
each
of
their
states
And
they
've
also
joined
me
in
call
ing
on
Congress
to
raise
the
min
i
mum
wage
from
$7.25
to
$10.10
an
hour
Be
cause
it
would
give
nearly
800,000
Amer
i
cans
in
their
states
a
raise
-
and
lift
wages
for
about
28
mil
lion
across
the
coun
try
So
these
gov
er
nors
aren't
wait
ing
for
Congress
to
make
up
its
mind
And
in
my
State
of
the
Union
Ad

I
asked
Amer
ica's
busi
ness
lead
ers
to
go
ahead
and
do
what
they
could
to
raise
their
em
ploy
ees
wages
And
in
creas
ingly
it's
not
just
large
com
pa
nies
like
Costco
or
the
Gap
that
choose
to
pay
their
em
ploy
ees
higher
start
ing
wages
It's
smaller
busi
nesses
like
Jax
son's
a
fam
ily
-
owned
ice
cream
par
lor
in
South
Florida
They
an
swered
the
call
and
raised
their
wages
so
that
more
than
70
em
ploy
ees
would
earn
at
least
$10.10
an
hour
with
out
cut
ting
back
on

And
two

an
At

small

named
Darien

wrote
me
to
share
a
les
son
his
grand

taught
him

that
if
you
treat
your

ees
right
they
'll
treat
you
right
And
Vice

I

to

of
at

$10.10

It's

for
our
bot
tom

And

that

About
half
of
all
Repub

sup

rais
ing
the

It's
just
too
bad
they
don't

Be

the
Repub

who
do
serve
in

don't
want

Some
even

That's

what

and
ev

is

over

Gap's

ex

And
he's
right
-
rais
ing
Amer
i

wages
isn't
just
a
good
deed;
it's
good
busi

and
good
for
our
econ

It
helps
re
duce
turnover
it
boosts

and
it
gives
folks
some
more
money

at
lo

And
as
a

I

last

a

at

$10.10

In
the
year
since
I
first
asked
Congress
to
raise
the
min

wage
six
states
have
passed
laws
to
raise
theirs
and
more
states
are
work

as
we

But
only
Congress
can
fin
ish
the

and
lift
Amer

Right
there's
a
bill
be
fore
Congress
that
would
boost
Amer
ica's
min
i
mum
wage
to
$10.10
an
hour
That's
easy
to
re
mem
ber
-
"ten
-
ten."
That
bill
would
lift
wages
for
more
than
16
mil

with

It

a

It
was
a

that
we

all

That's
how
we

we

That's

five

this

Five

And
if
any

that

I
will
veto

We

In

it's

as
we

to

from
the

Last

since

This

Dur

the

peo

thought
the

But
we
chose
to
in

Amer

And
to
day
an
auto
in

try
that
was
flatlin
ing
six

ago
is
build

and
sell

new

at
the

in

Amer

at

in

That's
progress
we
can
be
proud
of.
What's
also
true
is
that
too
many
fam

still
work
too
many
hours
with
too

it.
And
the
much

in

isn't
some
thing
we
're

overnight
But
there
are
ideas
we
should
be
putting
into
place
that
would
grow
jobs
and
wages
faster
right
And
one
of
the
best
would
be
to
raise
