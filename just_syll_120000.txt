Soon

that

more

That's
im

be

even
as

one

I

A

And
many

find

In

In

So
al

our

this

not

The

But
over
the
long

the
only
way
we

avoid

to

it's

And
I

But
I

I

And
to

there's
no

2014

Four

This

as
some

to

out

but
around

it

And
the

I'm

The

The

ev

And
be

the

there's

This

It's

It's
about
keep

This

And

We

The
Pres
i
dent:
This
week
we
mark
the
eleventh
an
niver
sary
of
the
Septem
ber
11th
at
tacks
It's
a
time
to
re
mem
ber
the
nearly
3,000
in
no
cent
women
and
chil
dren
we
lost
and
the
fam
i
lies
that
they
left
be
hind
It's
a
chance
to
honor
the
courage
of
the
first
re
spon
ders
who
risked
their
lives
--
on
that
and
ev
ery
day
since
And
it's
an
op
por
tu
nity
to
give
thanks
for
our
men
and
women
in
uni
form
who
have
served
and
sac
ri
ficed
some
times
far
from
home
to
keep
our
coun
try
safe
This
an
niver
sary
is
about
them
It's
also
a
time
to
re
flect
on
just
how
far
we
've
come
as
a
na
tion
these
past
eleven
years
On
that
clear
Septem
ber
morn
ing
as
Amer
ica
watched
the
tow
ers
fall
and
the
Pen
tagon
burn
and
the
wreck
age
smol
der
ing
in
a
Penn
syl
va
nia
field
we
were
filled
with
ques
tions
Where
had
the
at
tacks
come
from
and
how
would
Amer
ica
re
spond?
Would
they
fun
da
men
tally
weaken
the
coun
try
we
love?
Would
they
change
who
we
are?
The
last
decade
has
been
a
dif
fi
cult
but
to
gether
we
have
an
swered
those
ques
tions
and
come
back
stronger
as
a
na
tion
We
took
the
fight
to
al
Qaeda
dec
i
mat
ing
their
lead
er
ship
and
put
them
on
the
path
to
de
feat
And
thanks
to
the
courage
and
skill
of
our
in
tel
li
gence
per
son
nel
and
armed
forces
Osama
bin
Laden
will
never
threaten
Amer
ica
again
In
stead
of
pulling
back
from
the
world
we
've
strength
ened
our
al
liances
while
im
prov
ing
our
se
cu
rity
here
at
home
As
Amer
i
cans
we
refuse
to
live
in
fear
To
day
a
new
tower
rises
above
the
New
York
sky
line
And
our
coun
try
is
stronger
safer
and
more
re
spected
in
the
world
In
stead
of
turn
ing
on
each
other
we
've
re
sisted
the
temp
ta
tion
to
give
in
to
mis
trust
and
sus
pi
cion
I've
al
ways
said
that
Amer
ica
is
at
war
with
al
Qaeda
and
its
af
fil
i
ates
--
and
we
will
never
be
at
war
with
Is
lam
or
any
other
re
li
gion
We
are
the
United
States
of
Amer
ica
Our
free
dom
and
di
ver
sity
make
us
unique
and
they
will
al
ways
be
cen
tral
to
who
we
are
as
a
na
tion
In
stead
of
chang
ing
who
we
the
at
tacks
have
brought
out
the
best
in
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
More
than
5
mil
lion
mem
bers
of
the
9/11
Gen
er
a
tion
have
worn
Amer
ica's
uni
form
over
the
past
decade
and
we
've
seen
an
out
pour
ing
of
good
will
to
wards
our
mil
i
tary
our
vet
er
ans
and
their
fam
i
lies
To
gether
they
've
done
ev
ery
thing
we
've
asked
of
them
We
've
ended
the
war
in
Iraq
and
brought
our
troops
home
We
brought
an
end
to
the
Tal
iban
regime
We
've
trained
Afghan
Se
cu
rity
Forces
and
forged
a
part
ner
ship
with
a
new
Afghan
Govern
ment
And
by
the
end
2014
the
tran
si
tion
in
Afghanistan
will
be
com
plete
and
our
war
there
will
be
over
And
fi
nally
in
stead
of
turn
ing
in
ward
with
grief
we
've
hon
ored
the
mem
ory
of
those
we
lost
by
giv

back
to
our

serv

those
in

and
reaf
firm
ing
the
val

at
the

of

That's
why
we
mark
Septem
ber
11th
as
a
Na

Day
of
Ser

and
Re

Be

And
we
look
out
for

--
not
just
on
the
dif

but
ev

Eleven
years
later
that's
the
legacy
of
9/11
--
the
abil

to

with
con

that
no

We

And
in

And

Michelle

I

as

There
are
so
many

ev

Amer

some

To

where
you

Serve

Even
the
small
est
act
of

the
sim
plest
act
of

is
a
way
to
honor
those
we

a
way
to
re

that
spirit
of

that
fol
lowed
9/11
On
this
10th
an
niver
sary
we
still
face
great
chal

as
a

We
're
emerg

from
the
worst
eco

in

We
're
tak

the

to
al

and
end

the

in

and
start

to
bring

Afghanistan
And
we
're
work

to
re
build
the
foun

of

here
at

None
of
this
will
be
easy
And
it
can't
be
the
work
of

alone
As
we
saw
af

9/11
the

of

has

So
as
we
mark
this

let's
sum

once
more
And
let's
show
that
the

of

that

Amer

doesn't
have
to

The

Hi,

This
La

Day

end
as
we
gather
with

and
friends
we
'll
also
come
to
gether
as
a

to
honor
some
of
our
own
-
the
work
ing
men
and
women
of
Amer
ica
across
the
gen
er
a

built
this
coun
try
up
and
helped
make
us
who
we
are
to

On
Mon

we
'll
cel

that
proud
his

We
'll
pay
trib

to
the
val

work
ing
Amer

em

-
hard
work;
re
spon
si
bil

sac
ri

look
ing
out
for
one
an

And
we
'll
recom
mit
our
selves
to
their
cause;
to
se
cur
ing
for
them
a
bet
ter
bar
gain
so
that
ev
ery
one
who
works
hard
in
Amer
ica
has
a
chance
to
get
ahead
over
the
past
four
and
a
half
years
we
've
fought
our
way
back
from
the
worst
re
ces
sion
of
our
life
times
And
thanks
to
the
grit
and
re
silience
of
the
Amer
i
can
peo
ple
we
've
be
gun
to
lay
a
foun
da
tion
for
stronger
more
durable
eco
nomic
growth
But
as
any
work
ing
fam
ily
will
tell
we
're
not
where
we
need
to
be.
For
over
a
decade
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
have
seen
their
wages
and
in
comes
stag
nate
even
as
cor
po
rate
prof
its
soar
and
the
pay
of
a
for
tu
nate
few
ex

For
even
longer
than
that
in
equal
ity
has
steadily
risen;
the
jour
ney
of
up
ward
mo
bil
ity
has
be
come
harder
And
in
too
many
com
mu
ni
ties
across
this
coun
try
the
shadow
of
poverty
con
tin
ues
to
cast
a
pall
over
our
fel
low
cit
i
zens
Rev
ers
ing
that
trend
needs
to
be
Wash
ing
ton's
high
est
pri
or
ity
And
it
sure
is
mine
That's
over
the
past
month
I've
trav
eled
all
across
Amer
ica
lay
ing
out
my
ideas
for
how
we
can
build
on
the
cor
ner
stones
of
what
it
means
to
be
mid
dle
class
A
good
job
that
pays
a
good
wage
A
good
ed
u
ca
tion
A
home
of
your
Health
care
when
you
get
sick
A
se
cure
re
tire
ment
even
if
you
're
not
rich
And
more
chances
for
folks
to
earn
their
way
into
the
mid
dle
class
as
long
as
they
're
will
ing
to
work
for
it.
The
truth
is,
it's
not
go
ing
to
be
easy
to
re
verse
the
forces
that
have
con
spired
-
for
decades
-
against
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
But
if
we
take
a
few
bold
steps
-
and
if
Wash
ing
ton
is
able
to
come
to
gether
with
com
mon
pur
pose
and
com
mon
re
solve
-
we
'll
get
there
Our
econ
omy
will
keep
get
ting
stronger
and
more
Amer
i
cans
will
be
able
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
mid
dle
-
class
So
this
La
bor
while
you
're
out
there
grilling
in
the
back
yard
or
tak
ing
that
fi
nal
trip
for
the
sum

I
hope
you
'll
also
take
a
mo
ment
to
re
flect
on
the
many
con
tri
bu
tions
of
our
work
ing
men
and
women
For
gen
er
a
tions
it
was
the
great
Amer
i
can
mid
dle
class
that
made
our
econ
omy
the
envy
of
the
world
And
as
long
as
I'm
Pres
i
dent
I'm
go
ing
to
keep
fight
ing
to
make
sure
that
hap

again
Thanks
and

The

To

I'd
like
to
speak
with
you
about
the
on

and
ur

ef

to

and

in

just

try

to

a

that
a
ma
jor
ity
of
Repub
li
cans
and
Democrats
in
the
Se

had
al
ready
said
they
wouldn't
vote
It's
a
plan
that
wouldn't
solve
our
fis
cal
prob

but
would
force
us
to
re
-
live
this
cri

in
just
a
few
short
months
It
would
hold
our
econ
omy
cap

to
Wash

pol

once
again
If
any

the
past
few

demon
strated
that's
not
ac

Any
so
lu

to

must
be

It
must

the

of
both

that
were
sent
here
to

re

the
Amer

--
not
just
one

of
one

There
are

to
re

this
prob

Congress
must
find
com

ground
on
a
plan
that
can
get
sup
port
from
both
par

in
the
House
and
in
the
Se

And
it's
got
to
be
a

that
I
can
sign
by
Tues

The

are
not
that
far
apart
here
We
're
in
rough
agree

on
how
much
spend
ing
we
need
to
cut
to
re
duce
our

And
we
agree
on
a
process
to
tackle
tax
re
form
and
en
ti
tle

re

There
are
plenty
of
ways
out
of
this
mess
But
there
is
very
lit
tle
time
We
need
to
reach
a
com
pro

by
Tues
day
so
that
our
coun

will
have
the

to

on

So

If
we
don't
for
the

ever
we

Not

we
didn't

to

we

but
be

we

And
make
no

for

on

a

could

on

--
we'd

That
would
be

they

In

The

Hi,
ev
ery
body
A
few
days
I
un
veiled
a
new
na
tional
plan
to
con
front
the
grow
ing
threat
of
a
chang
ing
cli
mate
Decades
of
care
fully
re
viewed
sci
ence
tells
us
our
planet
is
chang
ing
in
ways
that
will
have
pro
found
im
pacts
on
the
world
we
leave
our
chil
dren
Al
ready
we
know
that
the
12
warm
est
years
in
recorded
his
tory
have
all
come
in
the
last
15,
and
that
last
year
was
the
warm
est
in
Amer
i
can
his
tory
And
while
we
know
no
sin
gle
weather
event
is
caused
solely
by
cli
mate
change
we
also
know
that
in
a
world
that's
get
ting
warmer
than
it
used
to
be,
all
weather
events
are
af
fected
by
it
--
more
ex
treme
droughts
floods
wild
fires
and
hur
ri
canes
Those
who
al
ready
feel
the
ef
fects
of
a
chang
ing
cli
mate
don't
have
time
to
deny
it.
They
're
busy
deal
ing
with
it
--
the
fire
fight
ers
who
brave
longer
wild
fire
sea
sons;
the
farm
ers
who
see
crops
wilted
one
year
and
washed
away
the
next;
west
ern
fam
i
lies
wor
ried
about
wa
ter
that's
dry
ing
up.
The
costs
of
these
events
can
be
mea
sured
in
lost
lives
and
liveli
hoods
lost
homes
and
busi
nesses
and

And
Amer

of

ac
tion
in
higher
food
costs
in
sur
ance
pre
mi
ums
and
the
tab
for

So
the
ques

is
not
whether
we
need
to
act;
the
ques

is
whether
we
will
have
the
courage
to

be

it's

And
if
this
Congress
doesn't
do
it
within
the
next
few
weeks
the
United

will
de
fault
on
its
obli

put

This
is
im

rais

the

is
not

It
lets
us
pay
for
what
Congress
al
ready
spent
It
doesn't
cost
a
dime
or
add
a
penny
to
our
deficit
In
fact
right
our
deficits
are
al
ready
fall
ing
at
the
fastest
rate
since
the
end
of
World
War
II.
And
by
the
end
of
this

we
'll
have
cut
our
deficits
by
more
than
half
since
I
took
of

But
re
duc
ing
our
deficits
and
debt
isn't
even
what
the
cur

stand
off
in
Congress
seems
to
be
all
about
The
fact
is
Democrats
and
some
rea

Repub

are
will

to
raise
the
debt

and
pass
a

one
that
cuts
spend

on
what
we
don't
need
so
we
can

we

And
I
want
to
work
with
those
Democrats
and
Repub

on
a
bet

for
the
mid

But
there's
also
a
fac

on

of

who

So,
we

we

Both

But
here's
the
thing:
these

Congress
can
turn
them

Un

it
ap

that

--
in

--
they'd
rather
let
these
cuts
fall
squarely
on
the

And
here's
what
that
choice
means:
Once
these

take

Al

That's
what
this

means
Are

Th

Repub

need

And
I'm

they

Be

In

The
Pres

We
all
know
the
past
few
years
have
been
dif
fi
cult
for
this
coun

After
the
worst
re
ces

of
our
life
times
it's
go
ing
to
take
longer
than
any
of
us
would
like
for
the
econ
omy
to
fully
re
cover
But
there
are
plenty
of
steps
we
can
take
to
speed
up
the
re
cov
ery
There
are
things
we
can
do
--
right
now
--
to
help
cre
ate
jobs
and
re
store
some
of
the
fi
nan

se
cu

that
so
many
fam
i
lies
have
lost
the
other
side
isn't
so
op
ti
mistic
They
think
all
we
can
do
is
cut
taxes
--
es
pe
cially
for
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
--
and
go
back
to
let
ting
banks
and
cor
po
ra
tions
write
their
own
rules
again
That's
their
plan
But
I
think
they
're
wrong
We
tried
their
ideas
for
nearly
a
decade
and
it
didn't
work
out
so
well
We
can't
go
back
to
the
same
poli
cies
that
got
us
into
this
mess
We
've
got
to
move
for
ward
We
need
to
build
an
econ
omy
where
hard
work
and
re
spon
si
bil
ity
are
re
warded
--
where
you
can
find
a
good
own
your
own
home
maybe
start
a
busi
ness
and
give
your
kids
the
chance
to
do
even
bet
ter
That's
where
we
need
to
go.
And
I've
been
push
ing
Congress
to
help
us
get
there
by
pass
ing
a
few
com

Democrats
and
Repub

have
al

done
some
im

work
to

--
from
pass

tax
cuts
for

to
open
ing
up
new
mar
kets
for
Amer
i
can
prod
ucts
to
re
form
ing
our
patent
sys
tem
But
now
we
need
to
do
more
That's
why
we
made
Congress
a
handy
"To
-
Do"
list
--
just
like
the
kind
I
get
from
Michelle
It's
short
but
each
of
the
ideas
on
this
list
will
help
cre
ate
jobs
and
build
a
stronger
econ
omy
right
First
Congress
should
stop
giv
ing
tax
breaks
to
com
pa
nies
that
ship
jobs
over
seas
and
use
that
money
to
cover
mov

for
com

that
bring

back
to

Se

Congress
should
help
the
mil
lions
of
Amer
i
cans
who
have
worked
hard
and
made
their
mort
gage
pay
ments
on
time
re
fi
nance
their
mort
gages
at
lower
rates
and
save
at
least
$3,000
a
year
Third
Congress
should
help
small
busi
ness
own
ers
by
giv
ing
them
a
tax
break
for
hir
ing
more
work
ers
and
pay
ing
them
higher
wages
Small
busi
nesses
are
the
en
gine
of
eco
nomic
growth
in
this
coun
try
We
shouldn't
be
hold
ing
them
back
--
we
should
be
mak
ing
it
eas
ier
for
them
to
suc
ceed
Fourth
if
Congress
fails
to
act
soon
clean
en
ergy
com
pa
nies
will
see
their
taxes
go
up
and
could
be
forced
to

Th
ese
com

nies
are
putting
Amer
i
cans
to
work
and
help
ing
break
our
de
pen
dence
on
for
eign
Congress
should
ex
tend
these
tax

And
fi
nally
Congress
should
help
our
vet
er
ans
re
turn
ing
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
by
cre
at

a
Veter
ans
Job
Corps
Our
men
and
women
in
uni
form
have
served
this
coun
try
with
honor
Now
it's
our
turn
to
serve
them
So
that's
Congress's
"To
-
Do"
List
But
now
we
need
them
to
start
cross
ing
things
I
need
you
to
call
your
Mem
bers
of
Congress
write
them
an
email
tweet
and
let
them
know
we
can't
af
ford
to
wait
any
longer
to
get
things
done
Tell
them
now
is
the
time
to
take
steps
we
know
will
grow
our
econ

and
cre
ate
jobs
You
're

You

meet

your

And
your
rep

Let's

Congress
to
do
the

Let's

The

Over

And
we

any
of

to

all
the

But
there

But
Congress
has

There

This
makes
no

We
know
that
one

we
can

Their

So,
if

the

A

It's
not

It's
about

that

the

Right

are
set
to
ex

at
the
end

Time's
run

And
there
are
two
things
that
can
hap
pen
First
if
Congress
does
noth
ing
ev

fam
ily
in
Amer
ica
will
see
their
in
come
taxes
au
to
mat
i
cally
go
up
on
Jan
uary
A
typ
i
cal
mid
dle
-
class
fam
ily
of
four
would
get
a
$2,200
tax
hike
That
would
be
bad
for
fam
i
lies
it'd
be
bad
for
busi
nesses
and
it
would
drag
down
our
en
tire
econ
omy
Congress
can
avoid
all
of
this
by
pass
ing
a
law
that
pre
vents
a
tax
hike
on
the
first
$250,000
of
ev
ery
body's
in
come
That
means
98%
of
Amer
i
cans
and
97%
of
small
busi
nesses
wouldn't
see
their
in
come
taxes
go
up
by
a
sin
gle
dime
Even
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
would
get
a
tax
cut
on
the
first
$250,000
of
their
in

And
fam
i
lies
ev
ery
where
would
en
joy
some
peace
of

The
Se

has
al
ready
done
their
part
Now
we
're
just
wait
ing
for
Repub
li
cans
in
the
House
to
do
the
same
thing
But
so
they
've
put
for
ward
an
un
bal
anced
plan
that
ac
tu
ally
low
ers
rates
for
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
If
we
want
to
pro
tect
the
mid
dle
class
then
the
math
just
doesn't
work
We
can
and
should
do
more
than
just
ex
tend
mid
dle
class
tax
cuts
And
I
stand
ready
to
work
with
Repub
li
cans
on
a
plan
that
spurs
eco
nomic
growth
cre
ates
jobs
and
re
duces
our
deficit
--
a
plan
that
gives
both
sides
some
of
what
they
want
I'm
will
ing
to
find
ways
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
health
care
with
out
hurt
ing
se
niors
and
other
Amer
i
cans
who
de
pend
on
it.
And
I'm
will
ing
to
make
more
en
ti
tle
ment
spend
ing
cuts
on
top
of
the
$1
tril
lion
dol
lars
in
spend
ing
cuts
I
signed
into
law
last
year
But
if
we
're
se
ri
ous
about
re
duc
ing
our
deficit
while
still
in
vest
ing
in
things
like
ed
u
ca

and
re
search
that
are
im
por
tant
to
grow
ing
our
econ

--
and
if
we
're
se
ri
ous
about
pro
tect
ing
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i

--
then
we
're
also
go
ing
to
have
to
ask
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
to
pay
higher
tax
rates
That's
one
prin
ci
ple
I
won't
com
pro
mise
on.
After
this
was
a
cen
tral
ques

in
the

A
clear
ma

of
Amer

Repub

In

agreed
with

asks
some

but
a
lit

more
from
those
who

It's
the
only

a

with

even

And
it's
the
only

I'm

Every
one
agrees
we
need
to
bring
down
our

and
strengthen
our

for

The
ques

is
whether

pri

--
to

like
that

And
for

Re

We

While

And
with

we
could
've
found
our

with

once

on

That's
why
it's
so
im

that

Every

that

It

But

a
dif
fer
ence
for
ev
ery
Amer
i
can
Congress
needs
to
do
some
thing
And
Amer
ica
knows
it.
Right
there's
a
bill
that
would
boost
Amer
ica's
min
i
mum
wage
to
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an
hour
That
would
lift
wages
for
nearly
28
mil
lion
Amer
i
cans
across
the
coun
try
28
mil
lion
And
we
're
not
just
talk
ing
about
young
peo
ple
on
their
first
The
av
er
age

They

And

not
all
of

al
ways
see
eye

po
lit
i
cally
one
thing
we
over
whelm
ingly
agree
on
is
that
no
body
who
works
full
-
time
should
ever
have
to
live
in
poverty
That's
why
nearly
three
in
four
Amer
i
cans
sup
port
rais
ing
the

The
prob

is,
Repub

in

don't
sup

Some
even

In

pro

from

tab
lish
ing
their

That's
why
this
fight
is
so
im

That's
why
peo

like
John

Yas

are
giv

That's
why
sev

states

and

are
go

around
Congress
to
raise
their

That's
why
I'll
keep

Be

we

that
our

works

when
it
works

We
be

we

ev

who
works
hard
has
a
chance
to
get
ahead
That's
what
op
por

is
all
about
And
if
you
agree
with
us,
we
could

Repub

The
Pres
i

Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
spent
some
time
trav
el
ing
across
Iowa
talk
ing
with
folks
about
re
build
ing
an
econ
omy
where
if
you
work
hard
you
and
your
fam
ily
can
get
ahead
And
along
the
I
stopped
in
at
Cas
cade
High
School
to
thank
the
teach
ers
there
for
do
ing
such
a
great
job
--
and
wish
them
luck
as
they
head
back
to
the
class
room
for
this
school
year
There's
noth
ing
more
im
por
tant
to
our
coun
try's
fu
ture
than
the
ed
u
ca
tion
we
give
our
kids
And
there's
no
one
more
im
por
tant
to
that
ed
u
ca
tion
than
the
per
son
at
the
front
of
the
class
room
Teach
ers
mat
ter
Most
work
tire
lessly
with
mod
est
some
times
dig
ging
into
their
own
pocket
for
school
sup
plies
--
just
to
make
a
dif
fer
ence
They
give
ev
ery
thing
for
our
kids
--
and
in
re
turn
we
should
in
vest
in
them
But
here's
the
thing:
this
year
sev
eral
thou
sand
fewer
ed
u
ca
tors
will
be
go
ing
back
to
school
Since
2009
we
've
lost
more
than
300,000
ed
u
ca
tion
jobs
in
part
be
cause
of
bud
get
cuts
at
the
state
and
lo
cal
level
Think
about
what
that
means
for
our
coun
try
At
a
time
when
the
rest
of
the
world
is
rac
ing
to
out
-
ed
u
cate
Amer
ica
these
cuts
force
our
kids
into
crowded
class
rooms
can
cel
pro
grams
for
preschool
ers
and
kinder
gart
ners
and
shorten
the
school
week
and
the
school
year
That's
the
op
po
site
of
what
we
should
be
do
ing
as
a
coun
try
States
should
be
mak
ing
ed
u
ca
tion
a
pri
or
ity
in
their
bud
gets
even
in
tough
fis
cal
times
And
Congress
should
be
will
ing
to
help
out
--
be
cause
this
af
fects
all
of
us.
That's
why
part
of
the
jobs
bill
that
I
sent
to
Congress
last
Septem
ber
in
cluded
sup
port
for
states
to
pre
vent
fur
ther
lay
offs
and
to
re
hire
teach
ers
who'd
lost
their
jobs
But
here
we
are
--
a
year
later
with
tens
of
thou
sands
more
ed
u
ca
tors
laid
off
--
and
Congress
still
hasn't
done
any
thing
about
it.
In
fact
the
eco
nomic
plan
that
al
most
ev
ery
Repub
li
can
in
Congress
voted
for
would
make
the
sit
u
a
tion
even
worse
It
would
ac
tu
ally
cut
fund
ing
for
ed
u
ca
tion
--
which
means
fewer
kids
in
Head
Start
fewer
teach
ers
in
our
class
rooms
and
fewer
col
lege
stu
dents
with
ac
cess
to
fi
nan
cial
aid
--
all
to
pay
for
a
mas
sive
new
tax
cut
for
mil
lion
aires
and
bil
lion
aires
That's
back
wards
That's
wrong
That
plan
doesn't
in
vest
in
our
fu
ture;
it
un
der
cuts
our
fu
ture
If
we
want
Amer
ica
to
lead
in
the
21st
cen
tury
noth
ing
is
more
im
por
tant
than
giv
ing
ev

the

ca
tion
pos
si
ble
--
from
the
day
they
start
preschool
to
the
day
they
start
their

That's
why
we
launched
a
na

com
pe
ti

to
im
prove
our
schools
And
for
less
than
1%
of
what
our

spends
on

u

each

we
've
en
cour
aged
al

to
raise
their

dards
--
the
first
time
that's
hap
pened
in
a

That's
why
we
've
in

in

and

ed
u
ca

and
given
states
more
flex
i

on

And
that's

The

Hi,

Yes
ter

we
learned
that
our

cre

an

That

And
es

at

Wed
nes

more
than
half
of
Repub

cans
in
Congress
voted
to
shut
down
the

for
the

ond
time
in
two

For
tu

there
were
enough
votes
in

to
pass
a

to

Un

Look
that's

It

any

And
that's
why
I
will
not

like
the
one
Congress
sent

this

Here's
A
few

both
par

agreed
to
put
in
place
harm
ful
au
to
matic
cuts
that
make
no
dis

be
tween
spend
ing
we
don't
need
and
spend
ing
we
do.
Those
cuts
have
ac
tu

kept
our
econ

from
grow

faster
Even
worse
they
're
ac
tu

un

Here's
one
ex

If
we
don't

then
next

we

That's
not

It's
a
pre

for

And
it
shouldn't

We
should
in
vest
in

to

or
we
'll
pay
the

Congress
should
do
its
stop
kick

the

down

and
pass
a
se

bud
get
rather
than
flirt
with
an

A

is
one
that

That's

Hi,

In

you

Or

of

if
you

New

In

con

work

are

on

in

at
the

in

At

Home

And

But
one

Now
we
have
to
build

the

and
keep

for

I
never
be
lieved
that
the
best
way
to

with

mar

was
to
just
sit

That

through

We

And
in

We

As
a

just
this

hun
dreds
of

who

and

And
now
I
want
ev

in
Amer
ica
to
have
that
chance
I
just
wish
it
didn't
re
quire
an
act
of
Congress
But
it
does
So,
back
in
Fe
bru
ary
I
sent
Congress
a
plan
to
give
ev
ery
re
spon
si

home
owner
the
chance
to
save
about
$3,000
a

on
their

by

at
his

low

That's
the
equiv
a
lent
of
a
$3,000

It's
a
plan
we
know
will
work
It
has
the
sup

of
in
de
pen

non
par

o

and
lead
ers
across
the

in

It's
a
no
-
brainer
that
should
have
passed
eas
ily
But
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
banded
to
gether
and
kept
this
plan
from
even
com

to
a

They
banded
to

and
pre
vented
mil

of

--
in
clud
ing
many
of
you
lis
ten

to

--
from
sav

$3,000
a

That's
money
that
could
have
gone
back
into
the
value
of
your

or
your

col

sav

ac

That's
money
that
could
have
gone
into

busi

so
they
could

and
cre
ate
more

in
your

But
Repub

in
Congress
still
won't
let
that
hap

And
that's
only
held

The

Hi,
ev
ery
body
Four
years
af
ter
the
worst
eco
nomic
cri
sis
of
our
life
times
we
're
see
ing
signs
that
as
a
na
tion
we
're
mov
ing
for
ward
again
After
los
ing
about
800,000
jobs
a
month
when
I
took
of
fice
our
busi
nesses
have
now
added
5.2
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
past
two
and
a
half
years
And
on
Fri
day
we
learned
that
the
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
is
now
at
its
low
est
level
since
I
took
of
fice
More
Amer
i
cans
are
en
ter
ing
the
work
force
More
Amer
i
cans
are
get
ting
jobs
But
too
many
of
our
friends
and
neigh
bors
are
still
look
ing
for
work
or
strug
gling
to
pay
the
bills
--
many
of
them
since
long
be
fore
this
cri
sis
We
owe
it
to
them
to
keep
mov
ing
for
ward
We
've
come
too
far
to
turn
back
We
've
made
too
much
progress
to
re
turn
to
the
poli
cies
that
got
us
into
this
mess
in
the
first
place
For
ex
am
ple
--
two
years
we
put
in
place
tougher
com
mon
sense
rules
of
the
road
for
Wall
Street
to
make
sure
that
the
kind
of
cri
sis
we
've
been
fight
ing
back
from
never
hap
pens
again
Th
ese
rules
mean
that
big
banks
are
no
longer
go
ing
to
be
able
to
make
risky
bets
with
your
de
posits
And
if
a
big
bank
does
make
a
bad
de
ci
sion
they
pay
for
it
--
not
tax
pay
ers
And
we
also
put
in
place
the
strong
est
con
sumer
pro
tec
tions
in
our
his
tory
to
crack
down
on
the
worst
prac
tices
of
credit
card
com
pa
nies
and
mort
gage
lenders
But
for
some
rea
son
some
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
are
still
wag
ing
an
all
-
out
bat
tle
to
de
lay
de
-
fund
and
dis
man
tle
these
com
mon
sense
new
rules
Why?
Do
they
think
un
do
ing
rules
that
pro
tect
fam
i
lies
from
the
worst
prac
tices
of
credit
card
com
pa
nies
and
mort
gage
lenders
will
make
the
mid
dle
class
stronger?
Do
they
think
get
ting
rid
of
rules
to
pre
vent
an
other
cri
sis
on
Wall
Street
will
make
Main
Street
any
safer?
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
need
to
stop
try
ing
to
re
-
fight
the
bat
tles
of
the
past
few
years
and
fi
nally
start
do
ing
some
thing
to
ac
tu
ally
help
the
mid
dle
class
get
ahead
And
here
are
three
things
they
can
do
right
First
Congress
needs
to
step
up
and
guar
an
tee
that
98%
of
Amer
i
cans
and
97%
of
small
busi
ness
own
ers
won't
see
their
taxes
go
up
next
year
This
is
some
thing
that
ev
ery
one
says
they
agree
on.
It
should
have
got
ten
done
months
But
Repub
li
cans
in
Congress
are
stand

in
the
They
're

tax

for
98%
of
Amer
i
cans
hostage
un
til
we
pass
tax
cuts
for
the
wealth
i
est
2%
of
Amer
i
cans
Ask
them
how
that
helps
the
mid

class
Se
cond
Congress
needs
to
step

and
pro

chance
to

about
$3,000
a

on
their

by

I
gave
them
a
plan
to
do
that
--
back
in

It's
a

that

and

But
Repub
li
cans
won't
even
let
that
plan
come
to
a
vote
Ask
them
how
that
helps

Third

A

Repub

in

Ask
them
why
some
one
who
fights
for
this
coun

abroad
should
have
to
fight
for
a
job
when
they
come
home
In
other
words
ask
them
to
get
back
to
work
and
get
these
things
done
If
we
're

to

Every

If

Tell

We

Hello

I'm

this

Boe

has
been
in
this
com
mu

for
half
a

But
it's
what
they
're
do
ing
here
to
day
that
has
folks
re
ally
ex
cit

be
cause
at
this
plant
they
're
build
ing
the
plane
of
the
fu

--
the
Dream

It's
an
im
pres

sight
to
be
hon
est
part
of
why
I
came
was
to
see
it
up
close
But
I
also
came
be
cause
this
is
a
great
ex
am
ple
of
how
we
can
bring
jobs
and
man
u
fac
tur
ing
back
to
Amer
ica
You
the
last
few
decades
haven't
been
easy
for
man
u
fac

ing
in
this
coun
try
New
tech
nol
ogy
has
made
busi
nesses
more
ef
fi
cient
and
pro
duc
tive
--
and
that's
good
--
but
it's
also
made
a
lot
of
jobs
ob
so
lete
The
re
sult
has
been
painful
for
a
lot
of
fam
i
lies
and
a
lot
of
com
mu
ni
ties
Fac
to
ries
where
peo
ple
thought
they'd
re
tire
have
left
town
Jobs
that
pro
vided
a
de
cent
liv
ing
have
been
shipped
over
seas
And
the
hard
truth
is
that
a
lot
of
those
jobs
aren't
com
ing
back
But
that
doesn't
mean
we
have
to
set
tle
for
a
lesser
fu
ture
I
don't
ac
cept
that
idea
In
Amer
ica
there's
al
ways
some
thing
we
can
do
to
cre
ate
new
jobs
and
new
man
u
fac
tur
ing
and
new
se
cu
rity
for
the
mid
dle
-
class
In
Amer
ica
we
don't
give
up
--
we
get
up.
Right
that's
ex
actly
what
we
're
do
ing
Over
the
past
23
months
busi
nesses
have
cre
ated
3.7
mil
lion
new
jobs
And
man
u
fac
tur
ers
are
hir
ing
for
the
first
time
since
the
1990s
It's
now
get
ting
more
ex
pen
sive
to
do
busi
ness
in
places
like
China
Mean
while
Amer
ica
is
more
pro
duc
tive
than
ever
And
com
pa
nies
like
Boe
ing
are
re
al
iz
ing
that
even
when
we
can't
make
things
cheaper
than
China
we
can
make
things
bet

That's
how
we
're
go
ing
to
com

For
Boe

busi

right
now
is

Last

To

We
want
to
see
more
of
this
We
need
to
make
it
as
easy
as
we
can
for
our
com
pa
nies
to
cre
ate
more
jobs
in
Amer
ica
not
over
seas
And
that
starts
with
our
tax
code
No
com
pany
should
get
a
tax
break
for
out
sourc
ing
jobs
In
stead
tax
breaks
should
go
to
man
u
fac

ers
who
set
up
shop
here
at

Big
ger
tax
breaks
should
go
to

-
tech
man

fac

who
cre

of

And
if
you

you
should
get
help
fi
nanc
ing
that
new

that
new

or
train

for

It's
time
to
stop
re
ward
ing
busi

that
ship
jobs
over
seas
and
start
re
ward
ing
busi
nesses
that
cre
ate
jobs
here
in
Amer
ica
And
Congress
should
send
me
that
kind
of
tax
re
form
right
away
Another
thing
we
're
do
ing
is
to
make
it
eas

for
com

like
Boe
ing
to
sell
their
prod

all
over
the
world
be
cause
more

mean
more

Two
years
I
set
a
goal
of
dou
bling
ex
ports
over
five
years
And
we
're
on
track
to
meet
that
goal
--
ahead
of

We
have
a
big
op

right
now
to

not
only
an

that

an

she

The
Pres

Hi,
ev

body
Every
thing
we
've
done
over
the
past
six
years
has
been
in
pur
suit
of
one
over
ar
ch
ing
goal:
cre

ing
op

for
What
we
've
long
un
der
stood
though
is
that
some
com
mu
ni
ties
have
con
sis
tently
had
the
odds
stacked
against
them
That's
true
of
ru
ral
com
mu
ni
ties
with
chronic
poverty
That's
true
of
some
man
u
fac
tur
ing
com
mu
ni
ties
that
suf
fered
af
ter
the
plants
they
de
pended
on
closed
their
doors
It's
true
of
some
sub
urbs
and
in
ner
cities
where
jobs
can
be
hard
to
find
and
harder
to
get
to.
That
sense
of
un
fair
ness
and
pow
er
less
ness
has
helped
to
fuel
the
kind
of
un
rest
that
we
've
seen
in
places
like
Bal
ti
more
Fer
gu
son
and
New

It
has
many
causes
--
from
a
ba
sic
lack
of
op

to
groups
feel

un
fairly

-
which
means
there's
no
sin
gle
so
lu

But
there
are
many
that
could
make
a

and
could
help
And
we
have
to
do
ev

thing
in
our
power
to
make
this
coun
try's
prom

real
for
ev

ing
to

That's

last
Tues

at

I
sat
down
with

a

a

on
what
it

We
know
our
ef

since

we
've
brought

down

40

over

the

of

Amer

--
a
goal
we
're
on
pace
to
meet
And
there
are
pow
er
ful
ex
am
ples
of
how
we
can
re
build
an
econ

that's
fo
cused
on
what
our
coun

has
al
ways
done
best
--
mak

and
sell
ing
prod

all
over
the
world
that
are
stamped
with
three
proud
words:
"Made
in

This
is
im
por

be
cause
over
the
last

we
be
came
a
coun

that
re
lied
too
much
on
what
we
bought
and
con
sumed
We
racked
up
a
lot
of
debt
but
we
didn't
cre
ate
many
jobs
at
If
we
want
an
econ
omy
that's
built
to
last
and
built
to

we
have
to

We

which
is
what
helped
us
build
the
largest

That's

we
chose
to
pull
the

back
from

But
build
ing
an
econ
omy
that

isn't
just
about
mak

--
it's
about
open

new

for
