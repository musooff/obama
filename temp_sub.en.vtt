00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.769
hi everybody whether you're firing up

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.109
the grill fired up for some pal

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.009
or filling up the car from one last

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.779
summer road trip happy Labor Day weekend

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.270
we set aside Labor Day to honor the

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.419
working men and women of America in this

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.710
labor day we've got more to celebrate

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.750
over the past fifty three months our

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.020
businesses have added nearly 10 million

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.309
new jobs last month for the first time

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.340
since 1997 we created more than 200,000

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.110
jobs for six straight months and for the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.789
first time in over a decade business

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.220
leaders worldwide have declared two

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:52.360
years running that the number one place

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.710
to invest isn't China it's America so

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.780
there are reasons to be optimistic about

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.760
where we're headed and the decisions we

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.100
make now will determine whether or not

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.809
we accelerate this progress well their

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.509
economic gains flow to a few at the top

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.670
or whether a growing economy fuels

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.600
rising incomes and a thriving middle

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.060
class think about it this Labor Day the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.100
things we often take for granted like

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.960
Social Security and Medicare workplace

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.909
safety laws and the right to organize

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.219
for better pay and benefits even

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.700
weekends we didn't always have these

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.619
things workers and the unions who get

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.869
their back had to fight for them and

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.299
those fights built a stronger middle

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.579
class to build a stronger middle class

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.920
in today's changing economy we've got to

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.240
keep fighting we've got to fight for the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.359
right to affordable health insurance for

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.329
everybody the right to fair pay family

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:46.539
leave and workplace flexibility the

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.939
right to a fair living wage let me focus

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.979
on that last one for a minute in America

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.799
no one who works full-time should ever

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.130
have to raise a family in poverty a hard

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.869
day's work deserves a fair day's pay and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.029
raising the minimum wage would be one of

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.669
the best ways to give a boost to working

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:05.889
families it would help around 28 million

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:08.440
Americans from all walks of life pay the

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:11.349
bills provide for their kids and spend

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.530
that money at local businesses and that

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.530
grows the economy for everybody the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.880
bottom line is America deserves a raise

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.670
but until we've got a Congress that

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.530
cares about raising working folks wages

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.420
it's up to the rest of us to make it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.830
happen and in the year and a half since

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.690
I first asked Congress to raise the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.840
minimum wage Americans of all

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.240
walks of life are doing just that 13

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.730
states and EC have done their part by

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.650
raising their minimum wages for more

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.870
states have minimum wage initiatives on

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.430
the ballot of this November and the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.800
states where the minimum wage has gone

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.600
up this year have experienced higher job

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.700
growth than the states that have it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.650
business leaders the companies like the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.450
gap are doing their part they're raising

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.890
base wages for tens of thousands of

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.350
workers because they know it's good for

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.450
business mayor's across the country are

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.880
doing their part mayor Emanuel in

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.650
Chicago and mayor Garcetti in LA are

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.170
working to lift their city's wages

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.630
overtime to at least thirteen dollars an

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.880
hour I've tried to do my part by

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.320
requiring companies that get contracts

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.390
with the federal government to pay their

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.700
workers a fair wage of ten dollars and

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.860
ten cents an hour and earlier this month

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.020
the president of Kentucky State

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.410
University set a great example by giving

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.680
himself a 90 thousand dollar pay cut so

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.740
that he could give raises to his lowest

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.450
paid employees his sacrifice will give

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.280
more of his workers and their families a

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.590
little extra money to help make ends

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.850
meet that's how America built the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.160
greatest middle class the world has ever

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.320
known now by making sure a fortunate few

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.670
at the top are doing well but I'm making

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.850
sure that everyone who's willing to work

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.410
hard and play by the rules can get ahead

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.590
that's the bedrock this country is built

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.930
on hard work responsibility sacrifice

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.600
and looking out for one another as one

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.610
united american family so let's keep

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.560
that in mind this labor day and every

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.560
day have a great weekend everybody

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.890
