Just
this

we
saw
more
peo

for
un

ploy
ment
than
at
any
time
in
the
last
twenty
-
six
years
and
ex

agree
that
if
noth

is
done
the
un

could
reach
dou

its
Our

could
fall
$1
tril

short
of
its
full

which
trans

into
more
than
$12,000
in
lost
in
come
for
a
fam

And
we
could
lose
a
gen

a

of

ten

as
more
young
Amer
i

are
forced
to
forgo

or
the
chance
to

of

In

if
we
do
not
act
boldly
and
swiftly
a
bad

on

I

It's
a
plan
that

save

three

and
one
that
rec

both

the

And
one
of

is
en
sur

that
the
foods
we

and
the

don't
cause

That's
the
mis

of
our

Ad

and
it
is
a
mis

shared
by
our
Depart

and
a

of
other

and
of

at

of

The
men
and
women
who
in
spect
our

and
test
the
safety
of
our
medicines
are
chemists
and
physi
cians
vet
eri
nar
i
ans
and
phar
ma

It's
be
cause
of
the
work
they
do
each
and
ev
ery
day
that
the
United
States
is
one
of
the
safest
places
in
the
world
to
buy
gro

at
a

Un
like
cit
i

of

many

Amer

can
trust
that
there
is
a
strong

to

that
the
med

we
give
our

will

and
that
a
fam
ily
din

won't
end
in
a

to
the

of

But
in
re
cent

we
've
seen
a
num
ber
of
prob

with
the

mak
ing
its

to
our

In

it

In

it
was

And
just
this
year
bad
peanut
prod

led
to
hun
dreds
of
ill

and
cost
nine
peo
ple
their

--
a
painful
re

of
how
tragic
the

can
be
when
food
pro

and
gov

is
un

Worse
these
in

re

a

that's

nearly
350
a

--
up
from
100
a
year
in
the
early
1990s
Part
of
the
rea
son
is
that
many
of
the
laws
and
reg
u
la

gov
ern

in
Amer

have
not
been
up

since
they
were

in

of
Teddy
Roo

It's
also
be
cause
our
sys

of
in
spec

and
en
force
ment
is
spread
out
so
widely
among
so
many
peo

that
it's
dif
fi
cult
for
dif
fer
ent
parts
of
our
gov

ment
to
share
in
for
ma
tion
work
to
gether
and
solve
prob

And
it's
also
be
cause
the
FDA
has
been
un

funded
and
un
der
staffed
in
re
cent
years
leav
ing
the

with
the

spect
just
7,000

our
150,000

each

That
means
roughly
95

unin

That

I

I

the

be

we
know
that
the
suc

of
Amer

is
in
ex

bly
linked
to
that
of
the
global

If
peo

in

can
not
spend
that
means
they
can
not
buy
the
goods
we
pro
duce
here
in
Amer

which
means
more
lost
jobs
and
more
fam

Just
yes
ter

we
learned
that
we
lost
hun

of

last

adding
to
the

we

Ul

the
only
way
out
of

that

is
with
a

that
is

That
is
why
I'm
pleased
that
af

All

All

Fi

I

in

That
is
where
al

trains

to

And
that

As
we
have
worked
this

to
find

and
strengthen

we
have
not

all
of

And
we

But
we
have
made

un

and
will
con

to

so
in
the
weeks

Be

in

The

That

Hi,

As

my

is
re

an

where
ev

who
works
hard
has
the
chance
to
get

That's
what
I'll
spend
some

talk

on
Mon

at

We

about
the

how
we
can
ad

Take

Many

don't

ad

to

so
work

can't
af

to
be

when
their

needs
them
the
most
That's
wrong
And
it
puts
us
way
be
hind
the
times
Only
three
coun

in
the
world
re
port
that
they
don't
of

Three
And
the
United
States
is
one
of
them
It's
time
to
change
that
A
few
states
have
acted
on
their
own
to
give
work
ers
paid
fam
ily
leave
but
this
should
be
avail
able
to
ev

be
cause
all
Amer

should
be
able
to

to

for
a

mem

Child

is
an
other
chal
lenge
Most
work

fam

I
know
can't
af
ford
thou
sands
a
year
for
child
care
but
of
ten
that's
what
it
costs
That
leaves
par

scram

just
to
make
sure
their

are
safe
while
they
're
at

--
for

the

qual

early
child
hood

u
ca

that
helps
kids
suc

in

Then
there's
the
is
sue
of
flex
i
bil

--
the
abil

to
take
a
few
hours
off
for
a
par
ent
-
teacher
con
fer
ence
or
to
work
from
home
when
your
kid
is
sick
Most
work
ers
want
it,
but
not
enough
of
them
have
it.
What's
more
it
not
only
makes
work
ers
hap

stud

show
that
flex
i

can
make

and
re

and
ab

That's
good
for
busi

At
a
time
when
women
make
up
about
half
of
Amer
ica's
work
force
out
dated
work
place
poli

that
make
it
harder
for
moth

to

hold
our
en

But
these
aren't
just
prob

for
women
Men
also
care
about
who's

ing
their

They
're
re

Lots
of

And
plenty
of
fa
thers
would
love
to
be
home
for
their
new
baby's
first

in
the
world
In
fact
in
a
new

nearly
half
of
all

women
and

-
re

that
they
've
said

they
didn't

but
be

would
be

When

But

have
de

that
the

it's

None

It's

that

come

than
al

any

on

But
there's
an
other
trend
that
threat
ens
to
un
der
mine
the
progress
you
've
helped
make
Even
as
cor

as
ever
a

ing
group
of

are

ing
the
coun

to
get
out
of
pay
ing

They
're
keep
ing
most
of
their

in
side
the
United

but
they
're
ba
si

re

their

zen
ship
and
declar
ing
that
they
're
based
some
where
else
just
to
avoid
pay
ing
their
fair

I
want
to
be
clear:
this
is
only
a
few
big
cor
po
ra

so
The
vast
ma
jor
ity
of
Amer
i
can
busi

pay
their
taxes
right
here
in

United

But
when
some

cher
ryp
ick
their

it
dam
ages
the
coun

fi

It
adds
to
the
deficit
It
makes
it
harder
to
in
vest
in
the
things
that
will
keep
Amer
ica
strong
and
it
sticks
you
with
the
tab
for
what
they
stash
off
shore
Right
a
loop
hole
in
our
tax
laws
makes
this
to
tally
le
gal
--
and
I
think
that's
to
tally
wrong
You
don't
get
to
pick
which
rules
you
play
by,
or
which
tax
rate
you
and
nei
ther
should
these
com
pa

The
best
way
to
level
the
play
ing
field
is
through
tax
re
form
that
low
ers
the
cor
po
rate
tax
rate
closes
waste
ful
loop
holes
and
sim

fies
the

Hi,
ev
ery
body
This
week
I
spent
some
time
in
Colorado
and
Texas
talk
ing
with
peo
ple
about
what's
go
ing
on
in
their
lives
One
of
them
was
El
iz
a
beth
Cooper
who
'll
be
a
col
lege
ju
nior
this
fall
She
wrote
to
tell
me
some
thing
I
hear
of
ten:
how
hard
it
is
for
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
like
hers
to
af
ford
col

And
she
shared
some
thing
I
know
many
of
you
feel
when
you
won
der
what's
go
ing
on
in
Wash
ing
ton
She
said
she
feels
"not
sig
nif
i
cant
enough
to
be
ad
dressed
not
poor
enough
for
peo
ple
to
worry
about
and
not
rich
enough
to
be
cared
about."
I
ran
for
Pres
i
dent
to
fight
for
Amer
i
cans
just
like
El
iz
a
beth
-
peo
ple
who
work
hard
do
ev
ery
thing
right
and
just
want
a
chance
to
build
a
de
cent
life
for
them
selves
and
their
fam
i
lies
And
af
ter
the
worst
eco
nomic
cri
sis
in
gen
er
a
tions
our
busi
nesses
have
now
cre
ated
nearly
10
mil
lion
new
jobs
over
the
past
52
months
The
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
has
fallen
to
its
low
est
point
since
2008
By
al
most
ev
ery
mea
sure
our
econ
omy
is
bet
ter
off
than
it
was
five
years
But
while
we
've
cre
ated
more
jobs
at
this
point
of
the
year
than
any
year
since
1999
too
many
fam
i
lies
barely
earn
what
they
did
in
1999
It's
harder
to
pay
for
col
lege
save
or
re
tire
be
cause
peo
ple's
wages
and
in
comes
have
not
gone
up.
Nearly
all
the
gains
of
the
re
cov
ery
are
go
ing
to
the
very
top
-
and
aren't
mak
ing
a
dif
fer
ence
in

And
I
be
lieve
Amer
ica
does
bet
ter
when
the
mid

does
bet

And
I've
laid
out
an
op
por
tu

agenda
to
cre
ate
jobs
train
work
ers
ed
u
cate
our
kids
and
make
sure
hard
work
ac
tu

pays
Th
ese
are
the
things
we
should
be
do
ing
to
grow
the
mid
dle
class
and
help
folks
work
their
way
into
the
mid
dle
class
And
it's
pretty
un
con
tro
ver
sial
stuff
I
hope
we
can
work
to
gether
on
it.
And
I'm
al
ways
will
ing
to
com
pro
mise
if
folks
have
other
ideas
or
if
it
ad
vances
gen
er
ally
the
in

of

ing
Amer
i
cans
But
so
far
this
year
Repub

cans
in
Congress
have
blocked
ev

se
ri
ous
idea
to
strengthen
the
mid

Lift

the
min
i
mum
wage
fair

re

-
they
've
said
no

all
of

And
that's
when
I've
acted
this
year
to
help
work
ing
Amer
i

on
my
own-
when
Congress
won't
I've
taken
ac

lift

pay

And
the
Repub

plan
right
now
is
not
to
do
some
of
this
work
with

-
in

it's
to
sue
me.
That's
ac
tu

what
they
're
spend

on.
It's
a
po

i

stunt
that's
go

to

of

And
by

And
in
many
ways
that's
Amer

story
these
past
five
years
We
are
a
strong

knit
fam

that's
made

with

we

The
prob

keeps

And
as

as

we

The
Pres

Hi,
ev
ery
body
On
Fri
day
I
vis
ited
Fort
Bliss
in
Texas
where
I
met
with
some
of
our
ex
tra
or
di
nary
men
and
women
in
uni
form
to
mark
the
sec
ond
an
niver
sary
of
the
end
of
ma
jor
com
bat
in
Iraq
It
was
a
chance
to
thank
our
troops
for
the
out
stand
ing
work
they
've
done
over
the
last
decade
Fort
Bliss
is
home
to
sol
diers
who
took
part
in
ev
ery
ma
jor
phase
of
the
Iraq
War
--
from
the
ini
tial
as
sault
on
Bagh
dad;
to
the
years
of
fight
ing
block
by
block;
to
the
part
ner
ship
with
the
Iraqi
peo
ple
that
helped
give
them
a
chance
to
forge
their
own
des
tiny
And
while
the
war
it
self
re
mains
a
source
of
con
tro
versy
here
at
home
one
thing
will
never
be
in
doubt
--
the
mem
bers
of
our
armed
forces
are
pa
tri
ots
in
ev
ery
sense
of
the
word
They
met
ev
ery
mis
sion
and
per
formed
ev
ery
task
that
was
asked
of
them
with
pre
ci
sion
com
mit
ment
and
skill
And
with
no
Amer
i
cans
fight
ing
in
Iraq
it's
my
priv
i
lege
on
be
half
of
a
grate
ful
na
tion
to
once
again
con
grat
u
late
these
men
and
women
on
a
job
well
done
This
an
niver
sary
is
a
chance
to
ap
pre
ci
ate
how
far
we
've
come
But
it's
also
a
re
minder
that
there
is
still
dif
fi
cult
work
ahead
of
us
in
Afghanistan
Some
of
the
sol
diers
I
met
at
Fort
Bliss
had
just
come
home
from
the
bat
tle
field
and
oth
ers
were
get
ting
ready
to
ship
We
've
bro
ken
the
Tal
iban's
mo
men
tum
in
Afghanistan
and
be
gun
the
tran
si
tion
to
an
Afghan
lead
Next
month
the
last
of
the
troops
I
or
dered
as
part
of
the
surge
against
the
Tal
iban
will
come
home
and
by
2014
the
tran
si
tion
to
Afghan
lead
will
be
com
plete
But
as
long
as
we
have
a
sin
gle
Amer
i
can
in
harm's
we
will
con
tinue
to
do
ev
ery
thing
in
our
power
to
keep
them
safe
and
help
them
suc
ceed
That
means
giv
ing
them
a
clear
mis
sion
and
the
equip
ment
they
need
on
the
front
lines
But
it
also
means
tak
ing
care
of
our
vet
er
ans
and
their
fam
i
lies
Be
cause
no
one
who
fights
for
this
coun
try
should
have
to
fight
for
a
job
or
a
roof
over
their
head
when
they
come
home
I
also
told
our
sol
diers
at
Bliss
that
part
of
hon
or
ing
their
ser
vice
means
strength
en
ing
the
na
tion
they
fought
so
hard
to
pro
tect
As
we
turn
the
page
on
a
decade
of
it's
time
to
do
some
na
tion
-
build
ing
here
at
home
My
grand
fa
ther's
gen
er
a
tion
came
back
from
World
War
II
and
helped
form
the
back
bone
of
the
great
est
mid
dle
-
class
in
his
tory
They
helped
this
coun
try
come
back
stronger
than
be
fore
To
day's
vet
er
ans
have
the
skills
the
dis
ci
pline
and
the
lead
er
ship
skills
to
do
the
ex
act
same
thing
--
and
it's
our
job
to
give
them
that
chance
It's
time
to
build
a
na
tion
that
lives
up
to
the
ideals
that
so
many
Amer
i
cans
have
fought
for
--
a
na
tion
where
they
can
re
al
ize
the
dream
they
sac
ri
ficed
to
pro
tect
We
need
to
re
build
our
roads
and
run
ways
and
ports
We
need
to
lay
broad
band
lines
across
this
coun
try
and
put
our
vet
er
ans
back
to
work
as
cops
and
fire
fight
ers
in
com
mu
ni
ties
that
need
them
And
we
need
to
come
to
gether
to
make
Amer
ica
a
place
where
hard
work
is
re
warded
and
any
one
will
ing
to
put
in
the
ef
fort
can
make
it
if
they
That's
how
we
can
honor
our
troops
That's
the
wel
come
home
they
've
earned
Thanks
and
have
a
great

The
Pres
i

Hi
there
As
you
can
I
brought
a
few
things
with
me
for
this
week's
video
A
pad
lock
A
pair
of
boots
A
can
dle
And
a
pair
of
socks
We
are
not
hav
ing
a
yard
sale
And
these
prod
ucts
may
not
ap
pear
to
have
much
in
com
mon
But
they
're
united
by
three
proud
words:
"Made
in
Amer
i
ca."
They
're
man
u
fac
tured
by
Amer
i
can
work
ers
in
Amer
i
can
fac
to

and
shipped
to
cus
tomers
here
and
around
the
world
The
com
pa
nies
that
make
these
prod

are
part
of
a
hope
ful
trend:
they
're
bring
ing
jobs
back
from
over

You
've
heard
of
out
sourc
ing
--
well
this
is
in
sourc
ing
And
in
this
make
or
break
mo
ment
for
the
mid

class
and
those
work
ing
to
get
into
the
mid
dle
class
that's
ex
actly
the
kind
of
com
mit
ment
to
coun
try
that
we
need
This
week
I
in
vited
ex
ec
u
tives
from
busi
nesses
that
are
in
sourc
ing
jobs
to
a
fo
rum
at
the
White
House
Th
ese
are
CEOs
who
take
pride
in
hir
ing
peo
ple
here
in
Amer
ica
not
just
be
cause
it's
in
creas
ingly
the
right
thing
to
do
for
their
bot
tom
line
but
also
be
cause
it's
the
right
thing
to
do
for
their
work
ers
and
for
our
com
mu
ni
ties
and
for
our
coun
try
I
told
those
CEOs
what
I'll
tell
any
busi
ness
lead
er:
ask
your
self
what
you
can
do
to
bring
more
jobs
back
to
the
coun
try
that
made
your
suc
cess
pos
si
ble
And
I'll
make
sure
that
you
've
got
a
gov
ern
ment
that
does
ev
ery
thing
in
its
power
to
help
you
suc
ceed
That's
in
the
next
few
weeks
I
will
put
for
ward
new
tax
pro
pos
als
that
re
ward
com
pa
nies
that
choose
to
do
the
right
thing
by
bring

jobs
home
and
in
vest
ing
in
Amer
ica
--
and
will
elim
i
nate
tax
breaks
for
com
pa
nies
that
move
jobs
over
seas
It's
also
why
on
Fri
day
I
called
on
Congress
to
help
me
make
gov
ern
ment
work
bet
ter
for
Right
we
have
a
21st
cen
tury
econ

but
we
've
still
got
a
gov

or
ga

for
the
20th

tury
Over
the
years
the
needs
of
Amer
i
cans
have
changed
but
our
gov
ern
ment
has
In
fact
it's
got
ten
even
more
com
plex
And
that
has
to
change
That's
why
I
asked
Congress
to
re
in
state
the
au
thor
ity
that
past
pres
i
dents
have
had
to
stream
line
and
re
form
the
Ex

This
is
the

sort
of

that
ev

busi

owner
has
to
make
sure
that
his

It's
the

au

that

had
for
over
50
years
--
un

And
let
me
be
clear:
I
will
only
use
this
au

for

that
re

in
more
ef

bet

and
a

Th

changes
will
make
it
eas

for

own

to
get
the
loans
and
sup
port
they

For

One

where

can
go

to

they

And
in

Great
Re

sion
It's
changed
to
the
point
where
even
when
folks
have
jobs;
even
when
the
econ
omy
is
grow
ing;
it's
harder
for
hard
work
ing
fam
i
lies
to
pull
them
selves
out
of
poverty
harder
for
young
peo
ple
to
start
out
on
their
ca
reers
and
tougher
for
work
ers
to
re
tire
when
they
want
to.
That's
a
big
part
of
the
rea
son
a
lot
of
work
ing
fam
i
lies
are
feel
ing
anx
ious
And
it
of
fends
our
fun
da
men
tally
Amer
i
can
be
lief
that
ev
ery
body
who
works
hard
should
be
able
to
get
ahead
That's
why
we
've
been
fight
ing
so
hard
to
give

i

more
op
por

and
more
se

-
by
work
ing
to
cre
ate
more
good
jobs
in

in
our
mid
dle
class
and
help
work
ing
peo
ple
get
a
raise
It's
what
the
Af
ford
able
Care
Act
is
all
about
-
fill
ing
in
the
gaps
in
em
ployer
-
based
care
so
that
when
some
body
loses
a
or
goes
back
to
school
or
starts
that
new
busi
ness
they
still
have
health
care
And
it's
why
I
be
lieve
we
've
got
to
take
steps
to
mod
ern
ize
our
un
em

If
a
hard
work
ing
Amer
i
can
loses
her
re
gard
less
of
what
state
she
lives
in,
we
should
make
sure
she
can
get
un
em
ploy
ment
in
sur
ance
and
some
help
to
re
train
for
her
next
If
she's
been
un
em
ployed
for
a
while
we
should
reach
out
to
her
and
con
nect
her
with
ca
reer
coun
sel
ing
And
if
she
finds
a
new
job
that
doesn't
pay
as
much
as
her
old
we
should
of
fer
some
wage
in
sur
ance
that
helps
her
pay
her
bills
Un
der
my
plan
ex
pe
ri
enced
work
ers
who
now
make
less
than
$50,000
could
re
place
half
of
their
lost
wages
-
up
to
$10,000
over
two
years
It's
a
way
to
give
fam
i
lies
some
sta
bil
ity
and
en
cour
age
folks
to
re
join
the
work
force
-
be
cause
we
shouldn't
just
be
talk
ing
about
un
em
ploy
ment;
we
should
be
talk
ing
about
re
-
em
ploy
ment
That's
when
Amer
ica
works
best
-
when
ev
ery
one
has
op
por
tu

when
ev
ery

has
some
se
cu
ri

and
when
ev
ery
one
can
con
trib
ute
to
this
coun
try
we
love
That's
how
we
make
sure
that
hard
work
ing
fam
i

can
get
ahead
And
that's
what
I'll
be
fight

A

I
re

a

from
a

named
Brenda
Breece
I
wanted
to

Wash

Brenda's
a

and
a

from
Mis

Her
hus
band
David
was
em
ployed
at
the
lo

Chrysler

for
nearly
four
decades
They
've
worked
hard
their
whole
lives
But
like
a
lot
of
folks
they
've
taken
some
hits
over
the
past
few
years
When
the
Chrysler
plant
closed
David
had
to
take
early
re
tire
ment
His
pen
sion
helps
but
it's
half
of
what
he
earned
be
fore
Mean
while
be
cause
of

get
cuts
Brenda
has
had
to
buy
school
sup
plies
for
her
stu
dents
out
of
her
own
pocket
--
be
cause
it's
her
job
and
she
cares
about
those
kids
Money
has
been
tight
but
they
're
do
ing
the
best
they
And
like
so
many
fam
i
lies
they
are
sac
ri
fic
ing
what
they
don't
need
so
they
can
af
ford
what
re
ally
mat
ters
This
is
what
Brenda
told
me.
"I
feel
my
fam
ily
is
fru
gal
"We
go
to
the
movies...once
a
month
but
usu
ally
we
just
wait
for
them
to
come
out

I
watch
the
food
bud

com
bine
trips
into

[and]
use
coupons
...
and
we
trim
each
other's
hair
when
we
need
a
hair
cut."
So
Brenda
and
her
hus
band
know
what
they
can
do
with
out
But
they
also
know
what
in
vest

are

Their

The

But
it's
worth
it,
be
cause
it
will
give
her
the
chance
to
achieve
her

In

Brenda
is
look

for
a

to
en

as
she
put
it,
"the

we

And
there
are
real

that
our

more

over

last

than

But
this

we
also
re
ceived
the
first
es

over
the

And
it
re
minded
us
that

in

can
get

We
all
agree
that
it's

But
we
can't
just
cut
our
way
to

It
hasn't
worked
in
the
past
and
it
won't
work
to

It
could
slow
down

It
could
weaken
our

And
it
could
cost

not

in

What
we
need
in

is
a

an

that
says
let's

Al

Repub

Democrats
have
worked
to

to

That's
a

But
to
get
the
rest
of
the

need
a
bal
anced
set
of

For

the

But
that

Now

Congress

We

As
