And

I

there's

I've

the

I
don't
ac
cept
that
None
of

should
That's
why
we
launched
a

a

years

that's
helped
nearly
one
mil
lion
re

si

home
own

re
fi
nance
their
mort

and
save
an
av

age
of
$300
on
their
pay

each
month
I'll
be
the
first
to
ad
mit
it
didn't
help
as
many
folks
as
we'd
hoped
But
that
doesn't
mean
we
shouldn't
keep
try
ing
That's
why
I'm
send
ing
Congress
a
plan
that
will
give
ev
ery
re

si
ble
home
owner
the
chance
to
save
about
$3,000
a

on
their

by
re

at
his

low

No

red

No
more

less
forms
And
a
small
fee
on
the
largest
fi
nan
cial
in
sti
tu
tions
will
make
sure
it
doesn't
add
a
dime
to
the
deficit
I
want
to
be
clear:
this
plan
will
not
help
folks
who
bought
a
house
they
couldn't
af
ford
and
then
walked
away
from
it.
It
won't
help
folks
who
bought
mul
ti
ple
houses
just
to
turn
around
and
sell
them
in
spec
u
la
tion
What
this
plan
will
do
is
help
mil
lions
of
re
spon
si

home
own

who
make
their
pay

ev

but
un

couldn't

cause
their

val

kept
drop

or
they
got
wrapped
up
in
too
much
red

Here's
the
catch
In
or
der
to
lower
mort
gage

for
mil
lions
of
Amer
i

we
need
Congress
to
They
're
the
ones
who
have
to
pass

And
as
any
one
who
has
fol
lowed
the
news
in
the
last
six
months
can
tell
get

Congress
to

these

is
not
an
easy
That's
why
I'm
go
ing
to
keep
up
the
pres

on
Congress
to
do
the
right
thing
But
I
also
need
your

I
need

I

The

it

It

but
as
we
learned
in

re

we
're
not

And
just

at

our

faces
some
se

head

Gas

are
start

to
come
down
again
but
when
they
spiked
over
the
last
few

it
hit
peo

wal

pretty
hard
The

in

all

But
from

we
first
took

to

we
knew
the
road
to

We
knew
it

would
be

we

You

who
will

ever
it
takes
to

the

and
grow
this
econ

faster
Be
cause
while
we
can't
fully
con
trol
ev

thing
that
hap

in
other
parts
of
the
world
there
are
plenty
of
things
we
can

at

There
are
plenty
of
steps
we
can
take
right
now
to
con
tinue
to
cre
ate
jobs
and
grow
this
econ
omy
I
sent
Congress
a
jobs
bill
last
Septem
ber
full
of
the
kinds
of
bi
par
ti
san
ideas
that
would
have
put
our
fel
low
Amer
i
cans
back
to
work
and
helped
re
in
force
our
econ
omy
against
those
out
side
shocks
I
sent
them
a
plan
that
would
have
re
duced
the
deficit
by
$4
tril
lion
in
a
way
that's
bal
anced
--
that
pays
for
the
job
-
cre
at
ing
in

we
need
by

un

sary

ing
and
ask
ing
the

i
est
Amer
i
cans
to
pay
a
lit
tle
more
in
taxes
Since
then
Congress
has
only
passed
a
few
parts
of
that
jobs
bill
like
a
tax
cut
that's
al
low
ing
work
ing
Amer
i
cans
to
keep
more
of
your
pay
check
ev

And
that's
im
por
tant
But
Congress
hasn't
acted
on
enough
of
the
other
ideas
in
that
bill
that
would
make
a
dif
fer
ence
and
help
cre
ate
jobs
right
There's
no
ex
cuse
for
that
Not
when
so
many
peo

are
look
ing
for

Not
when
so
many
peo

are
still
strug
gling
to
pay
the

So
my
mes
sage
to
Congress
is,
let's
get
to
work
Right
Congress
should
pass
a
bill
to
help
states
pre
vent
more
lay
offs
so
we
can
put
thou
sands
of
teach
ers
and
fire
fight
ers
and
po
lice
of
fi
cers
back
on
the
Congress
should
have
passed
a
bill
a
long
time
ago
to
put
thou
sands
of
con
struc
tion
work

even

I
know
there
are
some
who
think
that
the

op

for

is
to
just
stand

and
hope
that
the

I
don't
agree

That's

That's

The

One
of
the

of

is
build

an

where
ev

one
gets
a
fair
shot
ev
ery
body
does
their
fair
share
and
ev
ery
body
plays
by
the
same
set
of
rules
And
as
many
Amer
i
cans
rush
to
file
their
taxes
this
week
end
it's
worth
point
ing
out
that
we
've
got
a
tax
sys

that
doesn't
al
ways
up
hold
the
prin

of
ev

This
is
not
just
about
fair

This
is
also
about
growth
It's
about
be
ing
able
to
make
the
in
vest
ments
we
need
to
strengthen
our
econ
omy
and
cre
ate
jobs
And
it's
about
whether
we
as
a
coun
try
are
will
ing
to
pay
for
those
in
vest
ments
In
a
per
fect
world
of
course
none
of
us
would
have
to
pay
any
taxes
We'd
have
no
deficits
to
pay
down
And
we'd
have
all
the
re
sources
we
needed
to
in
vest
in
things
like
schools
and
roads
and
a
strong
mil
i

and
new

of

in

We

And
we

the

this

Mem

are

to
have
a
chance
to
set

right
They
get
to
vote
on
what
we
call
the
Buf

Rule
It's
sim
ple:
If
you
make
more
than
$1
mil
lion
ev
ery
year
you
should
pay
at
least
the
same
per
cent
age
of
your

come
in
taxes
as
mid
dle

class
fam
i

do.
On
the
other
hand
if
you
make
less
than
$250,000
a
year
--
like
98%
of
Amer
i
can
fam
i
lies
do
--
your
taxes
shouldn't
go
up.
That's
all
there
is
to
it.
It's
pretty
sen
si
ble
Most
Amer

sup

We
just
need
some
Repub

can
politi

to
get
on

with
where
the
coun

is.
I
know
they
'll
say
that
this
is
all
about
want

to

They
prob
a

I've
cut

17

But
the
thing
is,
for
most
Amer
i

like
me,
tax
rates
are
near
their
low
est
point
in
50
years
In
2001
and
2003
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
re
ceived
two
huge
new
tax
cuts
We
were
told
these
tax
cuts
would
lead
to
faster
job
growth
In

we
got
the
slow

in

were
warned
that

In

fol

So

've
tried

It

And
mid

have

too

eroded
over

just

just
this

I

So
the

whether

Repub

in

want
more
of
those
tax
cuts
With
the
deficit
we
have
I
don't
think
we
can
af
ford
them
But
even
if
we
dis
agree
on
the
tax
cuts
for
the
wealth
i
est
Amer
i

we
all
agree
that
no
Amer
i
can
should
pay
more
taxes
on
the
first
$250,000
of
their
in
come
So
let's
at
least
agree
to
do
what
we
all
agree
on.
That's
what
com
pro

is
all
about
Let's
not

while
we

The

Hi,
ev

body
On
Fri
day
I
had
a
dis
cus
sion
with
work
ing
women
in
Rhode
Is
land
about
the
eco
nomic
chal
lenges
they
face
in
their
own
lives
--
chal
lenges
shared
by
many
of
Thanks
to
the
work
we
've
all
put
in,
our
econ
omy
has
come
a
long
way
these
past
six
years
Over
the
past
55
months
our
busi
nesses
have
added
10.3
mil
lion
new
jobs
For
the
first
time
in
six
years
the
un
em
ploy
ment
rate
is
be
low
6
per
cent
And
on
Thurs
day
we
learned
that
over
the
past
six
months
our
econ
omy
has
grown
at
its
fastest
pace
since
2003
But
the
gains
of
a
grow
ing
econ
omy
aren't
yet
felt
by
ev
ery
one
So
we
've
got
to
har
ness
this
mo
men
tum
and
make
the
right
choices
so
that
ev
ery
one
who
works
hard
can
get
ahead
In
re
cent
weeks
I've
talked
about
these
choices
from
rais
ing
the
min
i
mum
wage
to
cre
at
ing
new
jobs
in
con
struc
tion
and
man
u
fac
tur
ing
To
day
I
want
to
fo
cus
on
what
I
dis
cussed
with
those
women
--
the
choices
we
need
to
make
to
help
more
women
get
ahead
in
to
day's
econ
omy
Right
women
make
up
al
most
half
of
our
work
ers
More
women
are
their
fam
ily's
main
bread
win
ner
than
ever
be
fore
So
the
sim
ple
truth
is,
when
women
suc
ceed
Amer
ica
suc
ceeds
And
we
should
be
choos
ing
poli
cies
that
ben
e
fit
women
--
be
cause
that
ben
e
fits
all
of
us.
Women
de
serve
fair
Even
though
it's
2014
there
are
women
still
earn
ing
less
than
men
for
do
ing
the
same
work
We
don't
have
sec
ond
-
class
cit
i
zens
in
this
coun
try
--
we
shouldn't
in
the
work
place
ei
ther
So
let's
make
sure
women
earn
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
have
a
fair
shot
at
suc
cess
Women
de
serve
to
be
able
to
take
time
off
to
care
for
a
new
baby
an
ail
ing
par
ent
or
take
a
sick
day
for
them
selves
with
out
run
ning
into
hard
ship
So
let's
make
sure
all
Amer
i
cans
have
ac
cess
to
paid
fam
ily
leave
Preg
nant
work
ers
de
serve
to
be
treated
fairly
Even
to
day
women
can
be
fired
for
tak
ing
too
many
bath
room
breaks
or
forced
on
un
paid
leave
just
for
be
ing
preg
nant
That's
wrong
--
and
we
have
to
choose
poli
cies
that
en
sure
preg
nant
work
ers
are
treated
with
dig
nity
and
re
spect
New
par
ents
de
serve
qual

ford
able
child

There's
noth
ing
like
the
peace
of
mind
that
comes
with
know
ing
that
your
kids
are
safe
while
you
're
at
work
And
the
ben
e
fits
that
chil
dren
get
out
of
early
en
rich
ment
can
pay
off
for
a
life
time
But
in
many
states
send
ing
your
kid
to
day
care
costs
more
than
send
ing
them
to
a
pub
lic
uni
ver
sity
So
let's
start
de
mand
ing
Pre-K
for
our
kids
And
when
most
low
-
wage
work
ers
are
women
but
Congress
hasn't
passed
a
min
i
mum
wage
in
crease
in
seven
years
it's
long
past
time
that
women
de
serve
a
raise
About
28
mil
lion
work
ers
would
ben
e
fit
from
an
in
crease
in
the
min
i
mum
wage
to
ten
dol
lars
and
ten
cents
an

And
more
than
half
of
those
work
ers
are
women
The
lo
cal
busi
nesses
where
these
work
ers
spend
their
money
would
ben
e
fit
So
let's
do
this
--
let's
give
Amer

a
raise
All
of
these
poli
cies
are
com
mon

All
of
them
are
within
our
reach
We
've
just
got
to
speak
up
and
choose
them
Be
cause
they
'll
build
a
stronger
Amer

for
all
of

But
even
as
we

to

For
this

not

led
to
the

but
also
the

of

The

This

many
who

or
come

to

I've
heard
from

who
worked
hard
their
whole

but
in
their
golden

are
un

of
where

It

The

I
launched

that's
close
to
both
our

girls
ed

It's
called
"Let

And
its
goal
is
to
help
more
girls

to
school
and
stay
in
school
Right
62

who

can't
af

Maybe
the
risk
of
be
ing
hurt
or
kid
napped
or
even
killed
by
men
who
will
do
any
thing
to
stop
girls
from
learn
ing
is
just
too
great
Or
maybe
they
aren't
in
school
be
cause
they
're
ex

to
get
mar
ried
and
be
come
moth
ers
while
they
're
still
teenagers
--
or
even

In
too
many
parts
of
the
world
girls
are
still
val
ued
more
for
their
bod

than
for
their
minds
That's
just
plain
wrong
And
we
all
have
to
do
more
to
stop
it.
That's
the
idea
be
hind
"Let

We
're

it

at

due

to
the

And
since
I
took

cut

So
we

claimed

But
that

a

And
I
want
to

on

That's

Seven

The

Next

the
Se

will
vote
on
the
Amer

It's
a
bill
that
will
put
more
peo

to
work
and
put
more
money
in
the
pock

of
work
ing
Amer

And
it
will
pro
vide
our
econ

with
the
jolt
that
it

needs
right
This
is
not

The

could
have
very
real
ef

on
our

at
a
time
when
it's
al

But
this
jobs

can
help
guard
against
an
other
down

here
in
Amer

This
isn't
just
my
be

it's

not

in

But
if
we
don't
the
op

will
be
true
--
there
will
be
fewer
jobs
and
weaker
growth
So
any
sen
a
tor
out
there
who's
think
ing
about
vot

against
this

needs
to
ex
plain
why
they
would
op

some

that
we

would
im

If
the

think
they
have
a

they
should

Be

one
of

at

just
said
that
their

"wouldn't

for

If
their

doesn't

up,
the
Amer

what
it
is
that
Repub

don't

You

say
that
one
of
the
most
im
por
tant
things
we
can
do
is
cut

Well
they
should
love
this

The

Jobs
Act
would
cut

for
vir

ev

And
if
you
're
a

owner
that

or
hires
a

you

Why

The
pro

in
this

are
steps
we
have
to
take
if
we
want

that

we
also
have
to
rein

start

we

And

One

As

the

filled

with

New

for

so
young
whose

was
torn
away
far
too
soon
But
be
neath
the

we
also
felt
a
sense
of
re

-
that
these
tragedies
must

that
to
end
them
we
must
change
From
the
very

our

brave
who
stepped
for

in
the

that

might

their

And
they
were
joined
by

Over

to

In

Our

That's

we

That's

I
can't

this
plan
will
bring
back
all
the

we
've
lost
and
re
store
our
econ

to
full

overnight
The
truth
is,
it
took
nearly
a
decade
of
failed
eco

poli

to
cre
ate
this

and
it
will
take
years
to
fully

But
I'm
con

that
we

We
are

And
what
we
can't
af

right
now
is
to
go
back
to
the
same
ideas
that
cre

this

in
the
first

Un
for
tu

those
are
the
ideas
we
keep
hear

from
our

in
the
other

This

the
Repub

can
leader
in
the
House
of

re

of
fered
his
plan
to

It's
a
plan
that's
sur
pris
ingly
short
and
sadly
fa
mil
iar
First
he
would
re
peal
health
in
sur
ance
re
form
which
would
take
away
tax
cred
its
from
mil
lions
of
small
busi

own

and
take
us
back
to
the
days
when
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
had
free
rein
to
drop
cov
er
age
and
jack
up
pre
mi

Se
cond
he
would
say
no
to
new
in

in
clean
en

af
ter
his
party
al
ready
voted
against
the
clean
en

tax
cred
its
and
loans
that
are
cre
at
ing
thou
sands
of
new
jobs
and
hun
dreds
of
new
busi

And
third
even
though
his
party
voted
against
tax
cuts
for
mid
dle
-
class
fam
i
lies
he
would
per
ma
nently
keep
in
place
the
tax
cuts
for
the
very
wealth
i
est
Amer
i
cans
--
the
same
tax
cuts
that
have
added
hun
dreds
of
bil
lions
to
our
debt
Th
ese
aren't
new
ideas
They
're
the
same
poli
cies
that
led
us
into
this
re
ces
sion
They
won't
cre
ate
jobs;
they
will
kill
them
They
won't
re
duce
our
deficit;
they
will
add
$1
tril
lion
to
our
deficit
They
will
take
us
back
ward
at
a
time
when
we
need
to
keep
Amer
ica
mov
ing
for
ward
I
know
times
are
tough
I
know
that
the
progress
we
've
made
isn't
good
enough
for
the
mil
lions
of
Amer
i
cans
who
are
still
out
of
work
or
strug
gling
to
pay
the
bills
But
I
also
know
the
char
ac
ter
of
this
na

I
know
that
in
times
of
great
chal
lenge
and
dif
fi
culty
we
don't
fear
the
fu

--
we
shape
the

We
har

the

and
in

nu

of
the
most

Earth
to

We
do
it
with
op

and
we
do
it
with
con

That's
the
spirit
we
need
right
and
that's
the
fu

I
know
we
can
build
to

That's

Il

That
idea
has
never
even
been

Some
are
also
say
ing
that
cov
er

for

tions
would
be

Also
false
When

And

who

has
said
there

called
"death

--
an

no

to
me
and
to
the
Amer
i
can

Th
ese
are
phony
claims
meant
to
di
vide
us.
And
we
've
all
heard
the
charge
that
re
form
will
some
how
bring
about
a
gov
ern
ment
takeover
of
health
care
I
know
that
sounds
scary
to
many
folks
It
sounds
scary
to
me,
But
here's
the
thing:
it's
not
true
I
no
sooner
want
gov
ern
ment
to
get
be
tween
you
and
your
doc
tor
than
I
want
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
to
make
ar
bi
trary
de
ci
sions
about
what
med
i
cal
care
is
best
for
as
they
do
to
day
As
I've
said
from
the
be
gin
ning
un
der
the
re
form
we
seek
if
you
like
your
doc
tor
you
can
keep
your
doc
tor
If
you
like
your
pri
vate
health
in
sur
ance
plan
you
can
keep
your
plan
Pe
riod
the
source
of
a
lot
of
these
fears
about
gov
ern
ment
-
run
health
care
is
con
fu
sion
over
what's
called
the
pub
lic
op
tion
This
is
one
idea
among
many
to
pro
vide
more
com
pe
ti
tion
and
choice
es
pe
cially
in
the
many
places
around
the
coun
try
where
just
one
in
surer
thor
oughly
dom
i
nates
the
mar
ket
place
This
al
ter
na
tive
would
have
to
op
er
ate
as
any
other
in
surer
on
the
ba
sis
of
the
pre
mi
ums
it
col
lects
And
let
me
re
peat
--
it
would
just
be
an
op
tion;
those
who
pre
fer
their
pri
vate
in
sur
ers
would
be
un
der
no
obli
ga
tion
to
shift
to
a
pub
lic
plan
The
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
and
their
al
lies
don't
like
this
idea
or
any
that
would
pro
mote
greater
com
pe
ti
tion
I
get
that
And
I
ex
pect
there
would
be
a
lot
of
dis
cus
sion
about
it
when
Congress
re
turns
But
this
one
as
pect
of
the
health
care
de
bate
shouldn't
over
shadow
the
other
im
por
tant
steps
we
can
and
must
take
to
re
duce
the
in
creas
ing
bur
dens
fam
i
lies
and
busi
nesses
face
So
let
me
stress
them
again:
If
you
don't
have
in
sur
ance
you
will
fi
nally
have
ac
cess
to
qual
ity
cov
er
age
you
can
af
ford
If
you
do
have
cov
er
age
you
will
ben
e
fit
from
more
se
cu
rity
and
more
sta
bil
ity
when
it
comes
to
your
in
sur
ance
If
you
move
lose
your
or
change
jobs
you
will
not
have
to
worry
about
los
ing
health
cov
er
age
And
we
will
set
up
tough
con
sumer
pro
tec
tions
that
will
hold
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
ac
count
able
and
stop
them
from
ex
ploit
ing
you
with
un
fair
prac
tices
We
'll
pro
hibit
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
from
deny
ing
cov

age
be
cause
of
a
per
son's
med
i
cal
his

They
will
not
be
able
to
drop
your
cov
er
age
if
you
get
sick
They
will
not
be
able
to
wa
ter
down
your
cov

when
you
need
it
most
They
will
no
longer
be
able
to
place
some
ar
bi
trary
cap
on
the
amount
of
cov
er
age
you
can
re
ceive
in
a
given
year
or
a
life
time
We
'll
place
a
limit
on
how
much
you
can
be
charged
for
out
-
of
-
pocket
ex
penses
be
cause
no
one
in
Amer
ica
should
go
broke
be
cause
they
get
sick
And
we
will
re
quire
in
sur
ance
com
pa
nies
to
cover
rou
tine
check
ups
and
pre
ven
tive
care
like
mam
mo
grams
and
colono
scopies
There's
no
rea
son
we
shouldn't
be
catch
ing
dis
eases
like
breast
can
cer
and
colon
can
cer
on
the
front
That
makes
sense
it
saves
lives
and
it
will
also
save
money
over
the
long
-
run
Taken
to
gether
the
re
forms
we
're
seek
ing
will
help
bring
down
sky
rock
et
ing
costs
which
will
mean
real
sav
ings
for
fam
i
lies
busi
nesses
and
gov
ern
ment
We
know
what
a
fail
ure
to
act
would
bring:
More
of
the
same
More
of
the
same
ex
plod
ing
costs
More
of
the
same
di
min
ished
cov
er
age
If
we
fail
to
the
cri
sis
will
grow
More
fam
i
lies
will
go
with
out
cov
er
age
More
busi
nesses
will
be
forced
to
drop
or
wa
ter
down
their
plans
So
we
can
push
off
the
day
of
reck
on
ing
and
fail
to
deal
with
the
flaws
in
the
sys
tem
just
as
Wash
ing

has
done
year
af
ter

af

Or
we
can
take
steps
that
will
pro
vide
ev

Amer

and

a

sure
of

and

that
they
lack

It's
never
been
easy
mov
ing
this
na
tion
for
ward
There
are
al
ways
those
who
op
pose
it,
and
those
who
use
fear
to
block
change
But
what
has
al
ways
dis
tin
guished
Amer
ica
is
that
when
all
the
ar
gu
ments
have
been
heard
and
all
the
con
cerns
have
been
voiced
and
the
time
comes
to
do
what
must
be
done
we
rise
above
our
dif
fer
ences
grasp
each
oth
ers
hands
and
march
for

as
one
na
tion
and
one
peo
ple
some
of

Democrats
some
of
us
Repub
li
cans
all
of
us
Amer
i
cans
This
is
our
chance
to
march
for
ward
I
can't
prom
ise
you
that
the
re
forms
we
seek
will
be
per
fect
or
make
a
dif
fer
ence
overnight
But
I
can
prom
ise
you
this:
if
we
pass
health
in
sur
ance
re
form
we
will
look
back
many
years
from
now
and
this
was
the
mo
ment
we
sum
moned
what's
best
in
each
of
us
to
make
life
bet
ter
for
all
of
us.
This
was
the
mo
ment
when
we
built
a
health
care
sys
tem
wor
thy
of
the
na
tion
and
the
peo
ple
we
love
This
was
the
mo
ment
we
earned
our
place
along
side
the
great
est
gen
er
a
tions
And
that
is
what
our
gen
er
a
tion
of
Amer
i
cans
is
called
to
do
right
The
Pres
i
dent:
On
Fri
day
we
learned
that
more
than
two
dozen
peo
ple
were
killed
when
a
gun
man
opened
fire
in
an
el
e
men
tary
school
in
New
town
Con
necti
cut
Most
of
those
who
died
were
just
young
chil
dren
with
their
whole
lives
ahead
of
them
And
ev
ery
par
ent
in
Amer
ica
has
a
heart
heavy
with
hurt
Among
the
fallen
were
also
teach
ers
--
men
and
women
who
de
voted
their
lives
to
help
ing
our
chil
dren
ful
fill
their
dreams
So
our
hearts
are
bro
ken
to
day
We
grieve
for
the
fam
i
lies
of
those
we
lost
And
we
keep
in
our
prayers
the
par
ents
of
those
who
sur
vived
Be
cause
as
blessed
as
they
are
to
have
their
chil
dren
home
they
know
that
their
child's
in
no
cence
has
been
torn
away
far
too
early
As
a
na
tion
we
have
en
dured
far
too
many
of
these
tragedies
in
the
last
few
years
An

Any

So
we
have
to
come

and
we
